{"text": "Back in January i did a story on a leak that was claimed to be from britam defence. Since then the story has gone down some shady paths with daily mail being sued by britam defence to removed an article relating to the incident, infowars also picked up the story and has now recently removed this as well. The main reason behind all this is a lot of people are calling it out as a fake or doctored leak aimed at causing trouble and it appears that is exactly what it has done. There was emails with talks of chemical \u00a0warfare and with the recent incidents in Syria it came back into light leaving many new people asking about this data and if its true or not. I have had a independent 3rd party do an analysis on the data from the leak and the overall results come down to this leak was doctored with reasons why listed below. also yes i should have done this along time ago but the public had decided this was fake so i did not go any further. Email headers do not match up, which goes with what everyone was saying for a long time now. to be more exact the time stamps are misleading and appear to of been copy and pasted. So there, its classed as fake, the report and articles will stay published as an archive."},

{"text": "A few days ago, whilst browsing the MIT servers for fun we found an extremely disturbing email backup or draft on their servers which goes in-depth into the subject of \"KIDDIE-PORN\" and literally states \"A guide to child pornography\". The entire email is about child pornography and where to find it. It was not on a subdomain, it was not on an MIT user's folder, it was located in a random folder on their main domain. Disturbing, to say the least. Here is an excerpt from said email: \"The point is: if you look hard enough, YOU WILL FIND IT! Trust me! I've spent the last few years of my life doing little else except looking for it. (Okay, so I do a Mass once in a while. But then it's back to the old uudecode program for me!) (BTW, if anyone wants to see all the KIDDIE-PORN I've accumulated, email me and I'll send you a few megabytes. I'll need proof that you're over 45 years old, that you go to confession regularly) \" We feel it's our right to teach them a lesson. So here we have it, a huge amount of Emails sent/received from MIT."},
{"text": "After reading that and viewing all the files linked on the same page i was unable to find any further proof of this. After digging a bit deeper i have now been able to confirm that there is still live hosted versions of the said kiddie porn guides on MIT servers. In the email is a 5 part guide which explains the what, why, where, how to on child porn and even offers to share over 45gig of obtained data. IT also goes on to state the person is working 24/7 to obtain these files and images and what is even more scary about the whole thing is all the talk about church related things like pastors and\u00a0priests and is written by a person calling themselves FATHER. In the replies to the email appears to be people who are\u00a0irritated\u00a0at\u00a0receiving\u00a0the emails about child porn and are voicing it very well but its any wonder why they have no taken any further steps to contact\u00a0authorities or maybe they did as it is all dated back to 1995. So once again MIT is in shit and i have seen it for my own eyes. I do not want to and will not ever publish or link to something like this so\u00a0don't\u00a0even bother asking why. I have personally contacted MIT via 20 different departments asking the said documents to be removed, awaiting an\u00a0response\u00a0from them at time of publishing."},

Like so many around the globe, we have felt helpless in the face of such implacable evil. And today's insane attack and threatened invasion of Gaza was more of the same. But when the government of Israel publicly threatened to sever all Internet and other telecommunications into and out of Gaza they crossed a line in the sand. As the former dictator of Egypt Mubarack learned the hard way - we are ANONYMOUS and NO ONE shuts down the Internet on our watch. To the IDF and government of Israel we issue you this warning only once. Do NOT shut down the Internet into the \"Occupied Territories\", and cease and desist from your terror upon the innocent people of Palestine or you will know the full and unbridled wrath of Anonymous. And like all the other evil governments that have faced our rage, you will NOT survive it unscathed. To the people of Gaza and the \"Occupied Territories\", know that Anonymous stands with you in this fight. We will do everything in our power to hinder the evil forces of the IDF arrayed against you. We will use all our resources to make certain you stay connected to the Internet and remain able to transmit your experiences to the world. As a start, we have put together the Anonymous Gaza Care Package -"},

We encourage you to download this package, and to share it with your fellow Palestinians to the best of your ability. We will be with you. No matter how dark it may seem, no matter how alone and abandoned you may feel - know that tens of thousands of us in Anonymous are with you and working tirelessly around the clock to bring you every aid and assistance that we can.

{"text": "-------------------------------------------------- 1) How long have you been hacking for? *I have been hacking for about 10 years. The first thing I hacked was a gumball machine. You put the quarter in twist it really,really fast and you get the candy and your money back because the quarter spins so fast it stays in the slot and still activates the latch to release the candy without droping the quarter in the change bin. #WIn ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2) what was it that lead you to the hacking scene? *I first got into hacking when I learned by simply using a PC you can destory companies and lives while sitting on your ass. Also reverse engineering software too.Now that is fun building keygens with 8 bit music. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3) Is your family aware of what has been happening in your cyber life? *My family is well aware of what I'm doing,and they could care less. As long as I'm not stealing money or shit like that their like fuck it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4) What age bracket do you fall in? below 20, between 20-30 or above 30? *I am 19 years old,not a 40 year old loser living in the basement smelling like shit and does not shower and masturbates all damn day. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5) What was the intention of the hacking you have been involved with? *My intentions were to spread the word of #HFF Hack For Fun day,celebrated everyday! That's just this past year though. I have many reason for my attacks. Mainly though because I have the power. Just like the big bosses in Washington. Do what I want because I can and know how. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6) One of the most recent attacks was on an Australian education website, was this a planned or random target? *This was planned,I was testing out Backtrack 5-R3 (32 Bit) vs. (64 Bit) for SQLi,seeing which was faster.32 Bit won BTW ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 7) So out of all the attacks you have carried out what are the most memorable ones? *This is kind of a Script Kiddy moment and nothing cool like XSS but,my most favorite attack was when me and many others DDOSED (SOCA)last year. The good old days when LulzSec and CabinCr3w was still around and when SABU wasn't the FBI's bitch yet! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8) Do you ever feel sorry/remorse for any of the targets that have been hacked? *I only feel sorry when other hackers do dumb shit like hack medical and food supply sites,or sites that help people. Other than that fuck em! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9) What about the public and innocent people that get caught up in the the breaches? *Info just so happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 10) Do it worry you that more and more hackers are being arrested world wide? *Hell the fuck yeah! Just waiting for the day they kick in my door and and scream \"FBI,CCU (Cyber Crimes Unit) get the fuck on the floor! We got you now Mother Fucker! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11) Do you consider your self an \"anon\" or \"Anonymous\"? I consider myself a \"REAL NIGGA\" /anon ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 12) Do you have a message for all the followers that are interested in your hacks? *Yes! If you like what you see then contact me with a DM or email explaining you skill set in hacking and we can spread the lolz. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 13) Do you have any plans for upcoming attacks/releases? *Yes I do actually,I have some real upcoming hacks.I just been bullshitting around with SQLi because it's pretty addictive when you find good ones like I can and since it's hot this year so says zdnet. I'm currently working on #OpBigBrother and waiting for #OpPalestine to kick off. Winter Work! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 14) Do you mind if i publish the raw questions/answers? *No,It will give the FEDS something to do. I'm sure they will sift through this and compare it to my profiles and try to figure out who I could be. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The q&a can be found on"},

The bill would make homosexuality a crime punishable by death, and has drawn outrage from gay rights groups and governments around the world. But now, religious leaders in Uganda are pressuring Speaker Rebecca Kadaga to pass the bill as \"an early Christmas present\" to the people. Uganda is one of the most anti-gay countries in the world, and their government seemingly encourages this sentiment. A petition forwarded to the heads of state read in part that: \u201cWe cannot sit back while such destructive phenomenon is taking place in our nation. We therefore, as responsible citizens, feel duty-bound to bring this matter to your attention as the leader of Parliament \u2026 so that lawmakers can do something to quickly address the deteriorating situation in our nation.\u201d The bill would make homosexuality in certain people, like authority figures and parents, a crime punishable by death. Gay couples in consenting relationships would be subject to life imprisonment. Certain nations have promised to pull funding for Uganda if they pass the bill, which would instantly make Uganda one of the most anti-gay governments in the world.\""},

It also has a comprehensive visual display of the Faggot that is associated with the disruptions. In our research, it has been evidenced that @NaziGods Fag-Aura\u2122 is so powerful that over 9000 cocks have VANISHED from Twitter in the last month alone. We directly attribute the deteriorating condition of lulz/reality to the Faggotry of fake bitches such as @NaziGods who corrupt the scene with hype and hysteria thus transforming \"hacktivism\" into an episode of Judge Judy.

{"text": "By Jonathan Nichols"},
{"text": "First, I should establish my credentials to speak on this matter. I joined the army in 2006 as a PSYOP soldier (we deal in Propaganda and Counter-propaganda operations). I deployed to Iraq as a Tactical PSYOP soldier in 2008. I was Propaganda Analyst for USF-I in 2010, closing out OIF and starting Operation New Dawn. I deployed again in 2012 as a Atmospherics Manager, LNO to Combined Forces -Special Operations Command (CF-SOC), and LNO to the Combined Joint Psychological Operations Task Force (CJ-POTF). I have been monitoring online Jihadist activity since before Anwar Al-Awlaki released the first Inspire Magazine, and I was on station for Operation Cupcake (google it). I knew Junaid Hussain as TriCk from TeaMpois0n well before he ran off to join the jihad in Syria, getting a hellfire to the face for his efforts. Since that time I have taken a variety of roles with a variety of organizations, almost always having direct access to Jihadist propaganda. When it comes to online Jihadist activity, I\u2019ve been here since before it was cool."},
{"text": "John Schindler is former NSA, NAVSECGRU, NWC, and is in many ways my superior in both rank and experience. I bow to his expertise on all things Russia. I wish I would have had the honor of sitting in on one of his classes when he was a War College professor. In the right setting, I would be happy to salute him. All of that is to state that I respect this man\u2019s experience and expertise. However, in this case, I must disagree with his conclusions."},
{"text": "In the article, \u201cFalse Flags: The Kremlin\u2019s Hidden Cyber Hand\u201d, Schindler states in the header, \u201cThe Islamic State\u2019s hacking army doesn\u2019t actually work for ISIS\u2014It\u2019s part of the secret Russian online espionage effort against the West.\u201d This claim, if true, would be news to me and those I work with. With this in mind, and understanding that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, lets review his article."},
{"text": "I\u2019ve broken down the article, paragraph by paragraph, below. In short, Schindler\u2019s argument works like this."},
{"text": "I do not dispute that Russian hackers were behind the TV5Monde hack. I also do not dispute that there is a Russian online espionage effort against the West. I dispute the logic. It does not follow that because Russian\u2019s were involved of some of the hacks, that all of the Cyber Caliphate is a Russian espionage effort."},
{"text": "I will point to a similar situation as a way to point out the logical fallacy here:"},
{"text": "That is clearly absurd. That SOME of the hacks were FBI directed is without dispute, but to make the logical leap that ALL of them were would be a claim worth challenging. If Schindler\u2019s logic were sound, then we\u2019d expect to see Stratfor, Fox, PBS, and Sony bringing suite agains the FBI. That hasn\u2019t happened. It\u2019s not sound logic."},
{"text": "Further, here are a list of the most recent headlines about the Cyber Caliphate, pulled from"},
{"text": ":"},
{"text": "Do you believe that Russian intelligence is behind all of these (and the 60+ others on the list in the link)? Not likely. If one wants to make the claim that they are, they ought prove it with more than just the TV5Monde hack."},
{"text": "So, here\u2019s an alternative headline: \u201cRussian Intelligence is using the Cyber Caliphate to Advance Their Agenda.\u201d This would be a headline I could support! I do not see sufficient evidence in Schindler\u2019s article to support the theory that \u201cThe Islamic State\u2019s hacking army doesn\u2019t actually work for ISIS \u2013 It\u2019s part of the secret Russian online espionage effort against the West.\u201d Instead, what I find is sufficient evidence to claim that \u201cRussian online espionage efforts use the Islamic State\u2019s hacking army on occasion.\u201d"},

According to the documents the reason for the lower suggested amount is that according to the ARN the repairing company took more steps then was needed to clean and repair the infected system. The lady paid 566 SEK (62.42 USD) for the 2 year extension of the Panda Antivirus Pro 2015 in July 2015 and the computer was sent for repair around December 19th 2015, due to this the ARN has counted off the amount between July and the repair date near the new year."},

The information and wording on the canipre website is pretty \"big headed\" in my own personal opion, they very upfront about the ability to catch people breaking the so called internet laws with statements like \"The bad guys pick up the phone when we call.\".

{"text": "It has come to our attention that the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBc), has become less and less trustworthy in recent times. As British Citizens we are made to pay \u00a3145.50 license fee per year for the provision of good quality advert free entertainment and news. The BBc have forced students and members of the armed forces to buy TV licenses when they are living away from their family homes creating more revenue from many thousands of people. Anonymous understands that the BBc is the voice of the British Government but we feel that the misappropriation of these vast funds should now be addressed. The resignation and \u00a3400.000+ payoff of director general George Entwistle over the child abuse scandal surrounding former presenter Jimmy Savile and the chaos following flagship current affairs show Newsnight making possibly false allegations against a former Conservative Party politician. The BBc claim to be a Global News organization and yet they fail repeatedly to give an accurate unbiased report of National or International News. The most recent being to refer to Hamas (a democratically elected government) as a Terrorist group. Our armed forces fight and die to uphold and assist with freedom and democracy while the BBc try to undermine it at every available turn. The BBc have reported from Camp Bastion and Forward Operating Base's within Afghanistan for many years. Many members of the armed forces have died and many more have been injured. The BBc have pushed the success of this war, the reality is far different. The British Government have now announced that success in Afghanistan is unobtainable and the key objectives will never be achieved. The BBc are not being held to account by a certain Lord, as he is aware that the license payer would be paying the bill. Instead he believes it is better to go after twitter users with less than 1000 followers, the majority of whom also pay for TV licenses. This man seems prepared to spend vast sums of money to protect his reputation. If this reputation was worth a penny surely his word would clear his name. Internal investigations into Pedophiles although in cooperation with the Metropolitan Police (they MET should not be trusted also, but that is another op) is not sufficient there is a need for a truly independent public inquiry into this Institution. The BBc have failed to or inaccurately report on actions carried out by Anonymous and many groups from the #Occupy Movement there by guiding other media agencies, this is including but not exclusive to the original march on the London Stock Exchange #OLSX (until the gathering at the steps of St Paul's cathedral)."},

This is a warning to disobey your orders, to find the dignity to know the difference between right and wrong, and the courage to act on that. We are only asking that you open your eyes to the injustice you commit, the corruption you enable and the name you are defending. This is your last warning. As you have taken our identities, we now take yours. You have forgotten your actions not only reflect onto you as a Police Officer, but also reflect on you as a person; in uniform, and outside of your uniform, you will be judged. Sincerely, The People"},

{"text": "Citizens of the world, Anonymous has observed for some time now the trajectory of justice in the United States with growing concern. We have marked the departure of this system from the noble ideals in which it was born and enshrined. We have seen the erosion of due process, the dilution of constitutional rights, the usurpation of the rightful authority of courts by the \"discretion\" of prosecutors. We have seen how the law is wielded less and less to uphold justice, and more and more to exercise control, authority and power in the interests of oppression or personal gain. We have been watching, and waiting. Two weeks ago today, a line was crossed. Two weeks ago today, Aaron Swartz was killed. Killed because he faced an impossible choice. Killed because he was forced into playing a game he could not win -- a twisted and distorted perversion of justice -- a game where the only winning move was not to play. Anonymous immediately convened an emergency council to discuss our response to this tragedy. After much heavy-hearted discussion, the decision was upheld to engage the United States Department of Justice and its associated executive branches in a game of a similar nature, a game in which the only winning move is not to play. Last year the Federal Bureau of Investigation revelled in porcine glee at its successful infiltration of certain elements of Anonymous. This infiltration was achieved through the use of the *same tactics which lead to Aaron Swartz' death. It would not have been possible were it not for the power of federal prosecutors to thoroughly destroy the lives of any hacktivists they apprehend through the very real threat of highly disproportionate sentencing. As a result of the FBI's infiltration and entrapment tactics, several more of our brethren now face similar disproportionate persecution, the balance of their lives hanging on the severely skewed scales of a broken justice system. We have felt within our hearts a burning rage in reaction to these events, but we have not allowed ourselves to be drawn into a foolish and premature response. We have bidden our time, operating in the shadows, adapting our tactics and honing our abilities. We have allowed the FBI and its masters in government -- both the puppet and the shadow government that controls it -- to believe they had struck a crippling blow to our infrastructure, that they had demoralized us, paralyzed us with paranoia and fear. We have held our tongue and waited. With Aaron's death we can wait no longer. The time has come to show the United States Department of Justice and its affiliates the true meaning of infiltration. The time has come to give this system a taste of its own medicine. The time has come for them to feel the helplessness and fear that comes with being forced into a game where the odds are stacked against them. This website was chosen due to the symbolic nature of its purpose -- the federal sentencing guidelines which enable prosecutors to cheat citizens of their constitutionally-guaranteed right to a fair trial, by a jury of their peers -- the federal sentencing guidelines which are in clear violation of the 8th amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishments. This website was also chosen due to the nature of its visitors. It is far from the only government asset we control, and we have exercised such control for quite some time... There has been a lot of fuss recently in the technological media regarding such operations as Red October, the widespread use of vulnerable browsers and the availability of zero-day exploits for these browsers and their plugins. None of this comes of course as any surprise to us, but it is perhaps good that those within the information security industry are making the extent of these threats more widely understood. Still there is nothing quite as educational as a well-conducted demonstration... Through this websites and various others that will remain unnamed, we have been conducting our own infiltration. We did not restrict ourselves like the FBI to one high-profile compromise. We are far more ambitious, and far more capable. Over the last two weeks we have wound down this operation, removed all traces of leakware from the compromised systems, and taken down the injection apparatus used to detect and exploit vulnerable machines. We have enough fissile material for multiple warheads. Today we are launching the first of these. Operation Last Resort has begun... Warhead - U S - D O J - L E A - 2013 . A E E 256 is primed and armed. It has been quietly distributed to numerous mirrors over the last few days and is available for download from this website now. We encourage all Anonymous to syndicate this file as widely as possible. The contents are various and we won't ruin the speculation by revealing them. Suffice it to say, everyone has secrets, and some things are not meant to be public. At a regular interval commencing today, we will choose one media outlet and supply them with heavily redacted partial contents of the file. Any media outlets wishing to be eligible for this program must include within their reporting a means of secure communications. We have not taken this action lightly, nor without consideration of the possible consequences. Should we be forced to reveal the trigger-key to this warhead, we understand that there will be collateral damage. We appreciate that many who work within the justice system believe in those principles that it has lost, corrupted, or abandoned, that they do not bear the full responsibility for the damages caused by their occupation. It is our hope that this warhead need never be detonated. However, in order for there to be a peaceful resolution to this crisis, certain things need to happen. There must be reform of outdated and poorly-envisioned legislation, written to be so broadly applied as to make a felony crime out of violation of terms of service, creating in effect vast swathes of crimes, and allowing for selective punishment. There must be reform of mandatory minimum sentencing. There must be a return to proportionality of punishment with respect to actual harm caused, and consideration of motive and mens rea. The inalienable right to a presumption of innocence and the recourse to trial and possibility of exoneration must be returned to its sacred status, and not gambled away by pre-trial bargaining in the face of overwhelming sentences, unaffordable justice and disfavourable odds. Laws must be upheld unselectively, and not used as a weapon of government to make examples of those it deems threatening to its power. For good reason the statue of lady justice is blindfolded. No more should her innocence be besmirked, her scales tipped, nor her swordhand guided. Furthermore there must be a solemn commitment to freedom of the internet, this last great common space of humanity, and to the common ownership of information to further the common good. We make this statement do not expect to be negotiated with; we do not desire to be negotiated with. We understand that due to the actions we take we exclude ourselves from the system within which solutions are found. There are others who serve that purpose, people far more respectable than us, people whose voices emerge from the light, and not the shadows. These voices are already making clear the reforms that have been necessary for some time, and are outright required now. It is these people that the justice system, the government, and law enforcement must engage with. Their voices are already ringing strong with a chorus of determined resolution. We demand only that this chorus is not ignored. We demand the government does not make the mistake of hoping that time will dampen its ringing, that they can ride out this wave of determination, that business as usual can continue after a sufficient period of lip-service and back-patting. Not this time. This time there will be change, or there will be chaos... -Anonymous"},

{"text": "In South Africa things have become progressively worse since Mandela stepped down. The gangs have become stronger, bigger, and more ruthless than ever. We rest on our Loral's that we are a free nation however all that has happened is the poor have become poorer and the rich have become richer. Companies like Anglo American have decimated our vast natural resources and have paid our local workers next to nothing. In a result of that they have become angry leading to multiple strikes that have crippled our economy. But you must be thinking, strikes mining industries pah! A fast developing country like South Africa should be able to shake that off with all that 1st world investment they are getting! But corrupt politicians from both the ANC and the DA have put the country into a spiralling economic disaster! Then wall street happened which sunk my beloved country into a full on catastrophe. But once again 1st world countries came to our rescue by investing more money into our country which of course all went into building Zumaville which is a whole billion rand enterprise thats goal was to make a whole city in the middle of nowhere based on Zumas idea of a ideal city. Once our corrupt politicians plunged us into a poverty stricken country. Our citizens which were previously poor became so poor that crime was their only chance of survival. So the gangs grew and grew and as the competition for crime grew bigger and bigger they became more ruthless than ever before. They pay no respect to woman and children raping like its going out of fashion. This is partly our judicial systems fault as they do not have a high rate of rape convictions which makes a potential rapist much more lightly to rape. Specialists say that if the rapes in prisons were recorded the number of rapes each year would double. Now when I take a walk down the street of my beloved South Africa that has survived so much I have to watch my back for a mugger. If we keep our corrupt malicious government will a 1st world country be dumb enough to save us again? The answer is no they wont. But team GhostShell will, we have noticed how much you are in need of a savior not afraid of the law who can acces secure information and give it to you. Together with anonymouses #OpSAfrica team ghost shell will rid you of corruption, make all knowledge free and help South Africa out of crime, corruption and poverty. Together we can make a better South Africa for you. We stand together Divided by non We are legion We are team ghost shell and Anonymous together We are a hackers ultimatum We are active!"},
{"text": "After two months of investigations, Team GhostShell has finally managed to fingerprint the entire top business infrastructure of South Africa, tracing some of it's activities to other countries across the continent. As always, we will provide you with a glimpse of that world, so that everyone else can do their own research and draw their own conclusions from it. Although this time around, the goal was not to release a large portion of data, we will still provide you with enough non-disclosure accounts and records from a variety of businesses; corporations and governments. The point of it is to find and see for yourselves the connections these entities have with one another, how they conduct themselves on the financial playing field but also economically speaking, how they actually do business world-wide. The data here ranges from government, banking, mining, petroleum, management, networking, transport services, construction, education/academics, other enterprises. This project also ended up coinciding with one of our off-scene black operations regarding the oil industries in North Africa. Ties with the CIA have been made inside Angola and as such we'll release a small teaser about it as well to promote this. We are all ghosts living inside the shell."},
{"text": "We've noticed that PasteSite has currently closed their services for new pastes, due to \"resource usage rising higher than I can manage\" which we know that's bullshit. It would be quite embarrassing if we didn't check our leaking platforms now and then to see if any significant changes have been made. Same thing happened to PrivatePaste last summer when we hit China, a DDoS attack followed on it for three days straight, then it got contacted by Wall Street after the IT leak and it went out of commission for over a month. Scaring the owners of these places will only make things worse. It would seem that even the gist from Github now requires an account to use the bin. Epic! Just for the record, TGS uses these types of paste sites on purpose, because they're easy to manage. Anyone can report bad content on them and they get removed after a couple of days, one week tops. But if you guys prefer, we can switch over to chinese and russian doxbins hosted on multiple networks with anti-ddos protection at any given time. It'll also be a good opportunity for more shady characters to get their hands on the data as well. It's your choice. For now, we're saying goodbye to the old pastebins, you've all been great and welcoming the new batch for 2013."},

{"text": "Dear friends, foes and members of the media, Our name is Rex Mundi. We previously hacked into the Web servers of Belgian companies Dexia and AGO Interim and, respectively, American, Dutch and French companies AmeriCash Advance, Accord.nl and Credipret. Last week, we hacked into the server of Canadian multinational temp work company Drake International (drakeintl.com). We gained access to over 300,000 confidential job applicant records, in addition to data related to the company's clients. The data stored inside the website's database relates to candidates located in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Canada. We immediately contacted Drake International to offer them not to release the data in exchange of a mere $50,000 (fifty thousand US Dollars). So far, we have unfortunately not heard back from the nice folks over at Drake. Does this mean that they do not care about their clients and job applicants' privacy? You be the judge. They have until the end of this week to pay us. If they fail to comply, their entire database will be posted on Pastebin and on various other websites. Sample data: JOB APPLICANTS -------------- Let's take a look at poor Mike Easter from Australia first. His email address is"},
{"text": "and his password is \"just4me\" (not anymore!). He listed two references while applying for temp work: Lourdes Bonnici, who is Customer Service Manager at Coles Supermarket (Phone: 93983755) and Sister Helen Reed who is Principal at Mount Saint Joseph Girls College (Phone #: 93981555). Let's move on to Adene Heinz now, who lives in beautiful New Zealand. Her email address is"},
{"text": "and her password on the Drake Intl website is \"fransdekoc\". Her phone number is 0792681433. Bet you didn't imagine Drake Intl would fail to secure its server, Adene! Finally, here comes Daniel Lacroix from Canada. His email address is"},
{"text": "and his password is \"samantha\" (Girlfriend? Wife? Who knows...) Poor Daniel applied for a job (job ID 42671). First, things seemed to go well. The first message recorded in the Drake Intl DB reads: \"Interview Friday 10AM,\" but then things took a turn for the worst. After the interview, the Drake Intl consultant recorded the following message: \"too technical - would be bored.\" It can be tough getting temp work at Drake Intl! CLIENTS ------- One of Drake International's clients is eHealth Ontario from, obviously, Canada. This company's contact address is 777 Bay Street - Suite 701 and it is located in Toronto. Its phone number is 416-586-4141 and its login password on the Drake Intl website is \"eagles18\". The listed contact address is"},
{"text": "Dear clients and users of the Drake International website, You will, no doubt, be pleased to hear that your privacy is not even worth $50,000 to Drake. Let's recap here for a second. Earlier this week, we contacted Drake International to warn them that a security flaw had been found on their Web server and that we would release sensitive data contained in their database if we did not receive $50,000. Our philosophy is simple: \"You messed up, you need to own up to it and protect your customers.\" Apparently, Drake International disagreed since they did not reply to our emails. We then contacted Drake International again to warn them that some of the passwords contained in their database could also be used to access the email inboxes (GMail, Hotmail, etc...) of job applicants who had created an account on their website. We even provided an example by sending them the contents of the Hotmail inbox of a specific applicant. Still, no reply from Drake International. So, fellow hackers, feel free to use the contacts listed in the following leak and sell those addresses to spam lists, Or use the passwords to steal confidential information from those users' email inboxes. Or steal their identities. Or access their online banking accounts. But, please, make sure to tell your victims that they were scammed simply because Drake International refused to own up to their own shortcomings. Maybe then will they understand that they should have complied. Leak address (.txt file):"},

{"text": "Before arresting him, however, you wrongfully arrested several suspects whose computers had been hijacked. While this is unfortunate, it is understandable that even the police can make mistakes in the course of an investigation. More worrying, however, is the fact that you coerced confessions from these wrongfully arrested, innocent Japanese citizens. Of course, these facts eventually came to light, and the National Police agency was confirmed to be as technologically illiterate as everybody had always expected. This was deeply humiliating for you. Unfortunately, your response is both typical of your kind and yet, deeply regrettable. Because you are unable to cover up your actions, you instead blindly lash out at the Tor network, a mere tool used by the real culprit. What is regrettable is that Tor is not the dark and dangerous shadow network that you and the mass media would like to paint it as. Tor is merely a tool, and like all tools, it can be used both responsibly and irresponsibly. The truth is, the Tor network helps people in repressive countries, such as Tibet, bypass censorship and communicate with the outside world. It helps whistleblowers safely expose unethical behaviour by powerful people. Tor can and is used every day for noble ends. At our last count, there were 52 Tor nodes operating in Japan, several of those exit nodes. Each and every one of those nodes contributes to the strength and stability of the network, and the exit nodes in particular help users in less fortunate countries than ours. By discouraging Tor use in Japan, you weaken the strength of the entire network. You reduce the options for people in repressive regimes. And you rob your own people of a legitimate and perfectly legal tool they can use to protect their privacy in a world that regards it as less and less important with each passing day. We urge you to withdraw this report and renounce your recommendation for ISPs to block the Tor network in Japan. While governments are quick to label Anonymous as criminals or worse, we Anonymous in Japan are neither criminals nor cyberterrorists. We are activists, and we believe in protesting peacefully and legally. As such, we strongly discourage any other Anonymous cells around the world from engaging in any DDoS protests or website defacements. To do so would only encourage the NPA to be more aggressive in censoring the internet, and weaken the position of Japanese ISPs and telecom companies who are against the NPAs decision. To civil rights groups and Internet freedom activists around the world, we urge you to make public statements denouncing the NPAs recommendations. To tech media, we urge you to report on and carry this story, so that this act of censorship cannot be allowed to happen in the dark. To the National Police Agency, we strongly recommend that you focus on learning the necessary skills and tools to remain relevant in the 21st century. Network technology and the internet are here to stay. The genie cannot be put back into the bottle. Rather than trying to stamp out what you cannot understand, we hope that you can learn to adapt and join us in the modern day. We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget.

{"text": "Statement: Hello, leaders of the Government of Nova Scotia. We are Anonymous. We reacted with satisfaction to your announcement of an independent inquiry into the Rehtaeh Parsons case. But upon further inspection, the depths of your cynicism and dangerous hypocrisy have been made clear to us. Rehtaeh's family continues to endure harassment and intimidation at the hands of these young men and their so called supporters. And your inquiry omits critical pieces of the puzzle, all designed to safeguard your power. We call upon the public to speak loudly to this conduct and remind her family and the world that we are still here. What is being done is not yet enough. Darrell Dexter, the eyes of the world are upon you. This case is being heralded as the quintessential example of rape culture and its devastating effects on humanity. You have an opportunity to determine the causes and potential solutions to one of the most troubling and complex subjects of our time. It is your duty to present the unvarnished facts of this case not only to Nova Scotians, but to the world. The public deserves to know why everyone from The RCMP to elected officials did not act until they were made to. Instead of seizing this chance to learn and educate, you have responded by dragging your feet, protecting your own interests, and acting with unrepentant cynicism. The independent inquiry you have ordered is but a shade of what is required to get to the bottom of this case. Rehtaeh was failed not only by the police, prosecutors, and school board. She was failed by her school, her hospital, her mental health care system, her community, and you. You hoped we would not notice the independent review stops immediately at the doors of your offices. You thought we would let you get away with that didn't you? Think again. Anonymous issues the following new requirements to be met: 1. The independent inquiry will expand to include all government departments that should or could have helped Rehtaeh. Including: The Capital District Health Authority, Capital District Mental Health Services, The IWK Mental Health and Addictions Program, The Administration of Cole Harbour High School, The Nova Scotia Department of Justice, The Nova Scotia Department of Education, The Nova Scotia Department of Health, and The Office of the Premier. 2. A detailed and public apology from Justice Minister Ross Landry, by May 4th 2013. Mr Landry, the situation demands you take at minimum an hour of your time to read about rape culture before this happens. Consult your colleagues, take this opportunity to educate. Explain to the public your personal thoughts on any link between rape culture and your failure to act until forced. Without such an apology, you will have lost the moral authority to govern. 3. Any inquiry called into this tragedy will be fully transparent, open to members of the public at all junctures, and operate under the auspices of a neutral body whose job is not to form opinion, but to collect the facts for all future experts researching this field. 4. All non-independent investigations of government departments will immediately cease with all files related to this case frozen, including internal emails. We do not trust your hands on this evidence. Anonymous will not stop until these goals have been achieved. We invite all members of the public to participate in a day of action on Saturday May 4th, to bring Justice For Rehtaeh. If you cannot join us at Province House in Halifax, we encourage you to have your say in your own community. To Premier Darrell Dexter and the New Democratic Party: we have had to do your job for you once already. Do not make us do it for you again. After all, there is an election just around the corner. We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us. Source:"},

We have been patiently observing your organisation, as you have inflated, indoctrinating our young with your criminal mindset. You have capitalized on the misfortunes of our peoples, taking advantage of moments of fear, of terror, and of reconciliation, to spread hatred and animosity towards your fellow man. Your constant belligerence, like a pack of raving ignoramuses, furthering only bigotry and segregation. You have angered us considerably, and summoned our wrath irrevocably. Last week, an innocent Drummer, Lee Rigby, lost his life at the hands of two vile and demented human beings in the most horrific, and heinous manner ever witnessed on the streets of Britain. This villainous public display has thrown the United Kingdom into mourning; every community, and every congregation, extending their deepest condolences. You however, have used this as another excuse to further spread your campaign of hate, bigotry, and misinformation. Under the guise of national pride you have instigated crimes against the innocent and incited the subjugation of Muslims. We will not allow your injustices, your lies, and your stupidity, to further radicalize our youth into fearing and despising their fellow man. Our people are desperate for hope, in a hopeless society where our own government neglects us, where society has failed us, it is only natural to seek a relatable change maker. This sort of desperation, this quest for feeling of worth, is what you have taken advantage of. In this operation, we will begin the systematic and comprehensive desiccation of your cult. We will further expose your falsities and your attempts to censor, to your members, to the British public, and to the world as a whole. You will fall, we can say this with complete confidence. We are everywhere, you cannot hide, you cannot win We are the voices of all and the voice of one. It will not happen over night, but we WILL be victorious. We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us. #OpEDL @Operation_EDL"},

{"text": "Greetings hactivists and people of the world. We are sending this message to appeal to the tired and downtrodden people who oppose radical islam over the whole Earth. We are calling on everyone, from the Philippines to Michigan, to Toronto, to London, and Sweden to make their opposition to the tyranny of Islam known and heard. Recently radical islamists have started waging full scale jihad through disrupting internet services and sites belonging to people they disagree with, hate, or want to do harm to. We call on people to fight this Islamic cyber jihad. On July the 26th an operation to combat this cyber terrorism will be launched. The operation, named opislam, will begin. This operation is not against all muslims, just the terrorists who always uses their religion to justify their actions. Our self-defense, and retaliation was not something we decided on quickly. We reluctantly fight a battle we did not start. Though this is not a conflict of our choice, we will fight on our terms, not the enemy's terms. We are making a stand because our conscience tells us we have to. We fight back because we are tired of watching our people being murdered, children rapped and abused, and tired of the incessant attempts of the quote moderate end quote muslims to impose sharia law via ballot boxes and censoring everyone who dares to talk about their action and what is really going on. In Europe whole cities go up in flames and the western media won't say a word about it. They are either complicate propagandists or scared of winding up like the unfortunate young man in London. As recent events in the United Kingdom have demonstrated, the broad daylight terrorism which once was the sole providence of the middle east has spread to your streets, in your capitals and your very front yards. Radical islam is not hard to spot in the world, it's the abu saif Islamic terrorist group making trouble in the Philippines, Islamic groups in the America's attacking people who speak out against them, and the Islamic youth in Europe who seem to riot monthly now. How much worse does it have to get before sane people say enough? Our grievances with radical islam and moderate islam are as follows. Moderate islam seems incapable or unwilling to police the extreme members of their society. Radical islam seeks world domination either through willing conversion or at the end of a sword. Radical islamists brazenly commit brutal acts of barbarism like decapitating someone with kitchen knives and then claims to be victims. It is not westerners that gives them a bad name, its the criminals that terrorize and murder innocent people in the name of their religion, islam, that gives their society a bad reputation. Acting like savage marauders from the dark ages in today's civilization is unacceptable. Attempting to set in place and enforce a draconian legal system from a few thousand years ago is unacceptable. Waging asymmetric warfare, hiding behind women and children, crying about being a victim while brutally murdering people in cold blood is unacceptable. ....... While western governments seem to have surrendered to the madness, the citizens of the west do not have to surrender along also. Getting mad at people who kill your citizens in barbaric fashion is not a crime. Having issues with people who share the same goals as the murderers is also not a crime. Talking about the people who kill your fellow citizens, terrorize your society, and prey on your children should not be a crime. Arresting a pregnant woman for holding her nation's flag in her nation's capital is just a crying shame, and should be a crime. ....... Islamic fundamentalists hide themselves and their weapons of terrorism behind their own women and children in the Middle East. Islamic radicals and the people who share their goals hide behind their religion, government enforced censorship, and intellectually dishonest arguments in the west. Their actions across the globe from the Abu Saif in the Philippines, to the honor killings and harassment of decent citizens in North America, to the barbaric killing of people all over Europe and burning their towns to the ground has spoken for them."},

The American government is a target and enemy of Anonymous as well! This is not about country vs country - This is about we, the people, the 99% (of USA and of North Korea) vs oppressing and violent regimes (like USA gov. and N.K. gov)! We, the people, are gathering together because we are stronger now and we won't fight your wars anymore, we won't eat your shit anymore!!! We demand: - N.K. government to stop making nukes and nuke-threats - Kim Jong-un to resign - it's time to install a free direct democracy in North Korea - uncensored internet access for all the citizens! To Kim Jong-un: So you feel the need to create large nukes and threaten half the world with them? So you're into demonstrations of power?, here is ours: - We are inside your local intranets (Kwangmyong and others) - We are inside your mailservers - We are inside your webservers Enjoy these few records as a proof of our access to your systems (random innocent citizens, collateral damage, because they were stupid enough to choose idiot passwords), we got all over 15k membership records of www.uriminzokkiri.com and many more. First we gonna wipe your data, then we gonna wipe your badass dictatorship \"government\". To the citizens of North Korea we suggest to rise up and bring these motherfuckers of a oppressive government down! We are holding your back and your hand, while you take the journey to freedom, democracy and peace. You are not alone. Don't fear us, we are not terrorist, we are the good guys from the internet.

{"text": "Where to even begin, I honestly do not know what to say. So much has happened in the past year and a half, I am at a loss for a way to even start writing. It\u2019s been a journey since my arrest, obviously with court and just trying to maintain a somewhat normal life with what was obvious as my impending imprisonment. I want to thank everyone who has stood there by me since this all began; I don't even know where to begin expressing myself when it comes to the events that have transpired. Obviously, there were all of those who assumed I snitched on Hig and others. This has been saddening to me since the start. I don't know where all of these rumors began, but they were started off of assumptions and just grew into something bigger and bigger. The constant flip-flop of everyone as to their view of it has not ceased to amaze me. I haven't addressed these claims myself, and to be honest, I have had little interest in doing so. I was focusing on what was happening in my life at the time, and really needed to spend some time focusing on me. It has been a difficult time for me since this all began, as you can imagine, and I really just needed to get away from it all and improve myself. Did I assist the FBI in the arrest of Hig? It\u2019s quite apparent this has been the topic on everyone\u2019s mind during this all. There is such a simple answer to it, no. I mean, is it not overly apparent by the fact that his arrest warrant was issued by the court before I was even raided? I have seen such a loose understanding of the federal court system since this began in all those that have spread these rumors. I suppose before my arrest my true understanding of the court system was quite small as well, and to be honest, I can\u2019t blame those who jumped to rash conclusions so quickly. It was just weeks before my arrest that the information about Sabu turning and working in cooperation with the government came to light, tensions were high. That makes sense to me. What is beyond me is that no one truly addressed me and asked me how things were. They made rash assumptions that I was cooperating based on such outlandish theories. In the interest of squashing this ridiculous assumption that I cooperated in attempt to reduce my sentence, and aided in the arrest of Hig or others whom I was friends with. Included are photos of my PSR, the section being Factors that May Warrant Departure. For a summary of what this section is you can look at the websites included at the bottom of this page. The basics of this are that the PSR is used in sentencing. In the federal court system your sentence is based off of both your criminal background and a point system which gives you a level based off of your crime. It uses the federal sentencing guidelines to determine this level, which is represented in month-month sentence, for example 24-36 months. The federal sentencing guidelines require the judge to sentence the offender based on this system. In order for the judge to sway from these guidelines in sentencing other certain factors must exist to give him/her cause to do so. In this section of the PSR, which the judge reads before sentencing, it will clarify if any of those factors are present in a case. The most common departure being if a defendant cooperates with the government and assists in the prosecution of others. As you can see in my court documents which are included, there is no downward departure applicable in my case. Thus, my sentence is that of my sentencing guidelines and not reduced due to cooperation. (This document is not public, in all cases it is sealed at sentencing; obviously I have a copy, thus my ability to share it). It has been a long journey since this all began, I have had obviously not the easiest time in the world and now have just weeks before I must report to prison, in which I was sentenced 3 years, $227,736 restitution, and 3 years supervised release. Though I\u2019m sure this you already know. I honestly don't care what you think of this message, I\u2019m sharing it because it\u2019s what I wanted to do. Had I had the ability to show this sooner, I would have,but I had nothing but my word in the past and we all know minds were made and that would have done no good. With my impending sentence I have found myself reminiscing lately on the old days. There are many people I truly miss and who I had so many good times with. So many good memories I have of all of you, memories that will always remain with me. There are many people I miss sharing such good times with. @doxcak3 @VizFoSho @NASDAQEnema @MotormouthNews @anomally100 @katanon and @AnonO_o @Anonw0rmer @anonylulz just to name a few. Also @VinceintheBay still missing listening to your show. I truly hope you are doing well Hig, and hope for an early release for you. You have a child and wife to take care of and that\u2019s the most important thing in life right there. No matter what you may think, you were always a friend and always will be in my eyes. I hav loved every bit of getting to know you and working with you It further saddens me to see the fate of many who were always standing for their causes. Specifically, sup_g. I could go on and on about how ridiculous I find 10 years on a case started by entrapment led by the FBI through sabu, or the ridiculousness of Judge Preska not recusing herself with such a conflict of interest, as her husband being named in the release. One should never suffer consequences for exposing something that is wrong in the world. I hope you stay strong Jeremy and know that what you did will never be forgotten. The government can never stop the truth from getting out. To all of those who dislike Sarah or feel she fucked things up for me online: I honestly don't care about your opinion on that subject, I really don't. I have a new chapter of my life unfolding ahead of me and have had a huge change thus far in it. She has been there for me through thick and thin, helping me grow as a person and making me happy with who I am, and that will not change. She is my wife and anyone who truly cares about me or the friendships we have had will respect me enough to understand that. I will be locked up here soon and if anyone wants to write me or speak it won\u2019t be hard to get a hold of me through mail. Do I expect letters, no, but I feel the opportunity should be there if anyone wants to take the chance. More and more freedoms are taken away from us. They are taken away little by little, under whatever reason they choose to give at the time, be it in the name of national security or something else. People go about their everyday lives not caring even the slightest as their freedoms are taken right in front of their eyes. Something that never made any sense to me at all. Privacy is becoming a forgotten thing of the past as mass surveillance has progressed as an everyday thing in the world. I dont think I truly understood, truly appreciated these freedoms till I lost those that I had left, living under constant monitor and having to report all my activities to the government. Having to go away for years. Its something I would wish on no one. I hope everyone who is still out there, still trying to make a difference understands how important they are in the grand scheme of things. Appreciate the freedom you have, use every minute wisely to do better. You never know when it wont be there anymore. I still have such hope for all of you, as I have grown to know you all over the past few years I have found something in each of you. You all have something great to offer to the world, something great you can do with your lives. I am so glad I have had the privilege of getting to know you all and being able to call you my friends. I truly still believe so much in people\u2019s ability to make a difference in the world. To make a change, and I know that it will happen. I know that I will watch the world shape into a better place in my lifetime. It\u2019s all got to start somewhere; each person has the ability to make that difference. I appreciate everyone reading this and hope sometime in the future our paths will cross again. @ItsKahuna #FreeHammond #Freew0rmer #FreeManning #FreeBarretBrown PSR EXPLAINATION"},

{"text": ", sharply criticized the incident and said he investigation is needed to bring to justice those responsible for it. That\u2019s it. Not a word about a Ukrainian\u2019s involvement to the incident. While the \u201cconcern\u201d came precisely from Lithuania on one hand, it\u2019s logical since the victim is a Lithuanian national but then on the other hand, a key Ukraine-EU summit will take place in Vilnius. So, there is an associative array: EU representative murder \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 Vilnius. It\u2019s not difficult to guess to whom it harms most of all. Then, among the leaked documents there is also a letter of someone Muhammed Jumma to the president of a Russian company LUKOYL Vagit Alekperov. In the document as of May 19th 2013 Jumma writes that together with his partner Prince Valid Tawajiri he has established in Saudi Arabia a company that provides a broad range of services. Among all the rest (by the way here is a misprint in the text of the document \u2013 the name Saudi Arabia and KSA abbreviation are mentioned in one sentence) mr. Juma is complaining about \u201csubstantial degrading of relations with Ukrainian partners\u201d in terms of cooperation with the Ukrainian government and lack of support from its part. Here comes the name of Ukrainian company Naftogaz. The response to Juma came from the Russian industrial investment fund and here start the \u00a0snags. Firstly, the response comes as of May 18th 2013 that doesn't comply with the chronology. Secondly, there is a mark \u201cconfidential and private\u201d, which isn't usually put on such documents. Thirdly, the whole text is explanation of why mr/ Juma\u2019s relations with Ukraine degraded so much. Namely because \u2018Naftogaz\u00a0chief\u00a0Yevgeny\u00a0Bakulin is\u201d. Those who will study the leaked documents because of particular interest to Ukraine probably wont even remember all the details of this nonsense, but once again the tags \u201cUkraine\u201d, \u201cNaftogaz\u201d, \u201cBakulin is sick\u201d \u201cIncapable of conducting business affairs\u201d remain. Again minus 50 points to Ukraine\u2019s image. In the archive from the allegedly hacked mail box there is also a number of typical documents of the embassy, like logistic reports, respective requests for transit permission, CVs, way-bills, marriage registration certificates and so on. Probably it\u2019s an \u201centourage\u201d aimed at creating the impression of the authenticity of the documents. In the context of current complicated trade and economic relations between Ukrainian-Russian relations such informational actions are probably another lever of pressure aimed at damaging Ukraine\u2019s image in general, affecting positions of Ukrainian large businesses, undermining European lobby and enhancing the Russian one.

{"text": "Transcript of video:"},
{"text": "Citizens of the world, we are Anonymous Australia. In the following weeks there has been an outrage between two spectrums of Anonymous. Anonymous Indonesia and their supporters have been outraged by the spying on their citizens by the Australian Government in 2007. In response to this, Indonesian hackers had defaced more than 170 websites in an effort to send a message to the Australian government. In an effort, we, Anonymous Australia had to intervene in order for these websites to stop being attacked as they are not apart of the Australian government. Once Anonymous Indonesia listened, ASIS was taken offline for a few days through multiple Denial of Service attacks. However peace between Indonesia and Australian citizens wasn't long lasted. One last final warning was given to Anonymous Indonesia to stop. We gave the ultimatum \"We do not want a cyber war, do you?\". While there has not been many attacks since, the Indonesian media and hackers have been trying to start a civil war between the two spectrums. Today, as Anonymous Australia, we are here today to deny any claim that says Australia has attacked Indonesia. We do not want to war. We only wish to join together and expose our governments, not harm each other. There has been a lot of propoganda and misleading lies that has been said by the Indonesian community. The news site 'merdeka' has been spreading lies towards the Anonymous community. Since there is no face to Anonymous, it is much more easier to blame them. Through the leaked Pastebin, it is evident that the English is not fluent - is that not evident enough? See to it that we do not wish to war. We are Anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect Us."},

Ofc VMware will try to make like this Kernel is old and isn't used in its recent products. But thanks god, there is still such as thing as reverse engineering that will prove it's true destiny. Little sidenote about this release, it is the VMKernel from between 1998 and 2004, but as we all know, kernels don't change that much in programs, they get extended or adapted but some core functionality still stays the same. Voil\u00e0! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished.

With the help of it's sub-divisions, MidasBank & the newest branch, OphiusLab. One million accounts/records leaked. We are also letting everyone know that more releases, collaborations with Anonymous and other, plus two more projects are still scheduled for this fall and winter. It's only the beginning. To conclude this summer's hacking spree, I will be giving away to anyone who's up for the challenge three different access points to three different groups/crews out there. It's our way of saying how great it's been raiding with you and let's hope that it isn't over just yet. The access-points are the following: 1. Six billion databases from a chinese mainframe full of chinese & japanese technology. It's very possible that it has from other countries as well, we haven't checked them all for obvious reasons. 2. Over 105 billion databases to a US stockexchange mainframe/s. It's very possible that the actual number is over 1 trillion, I wasn't prepared the first time and it gave me a memory error after 105 when it tried to add another digit. This job will require you to have at least 1TB available. 3. Access-points to 3-4 different servers belonging to the Department of Homeland Security. The sensitive information isn't that great but it may be good for street cred. Ok, that's all. Whoever wants any of them, you can contact me at voxanon.

{"text": "> As you may be all aware, our actions are continuing non-stop since February. From that time our first action was against Ankara Security Headquarters and as a result seven innocent people got arrested and they are still imprisoned. The only evidence against them is a PlayStation Cd\u2019s. The dominant powers then decided to transfer the investigation about us to a prosecutor who once managed the Sivas case to drop due to time-frame elapsed, where 33 intellectuals and artists got killed by mob of bigots. Despite this we didn\u2019t stop and we were investigated by National Intelligence Agency (MIT) and complaint was made to Interpol. For disinformation reasons various news was made about us. We still did not stop. Ministry of Interior was hacked twice, 95% of police forces in Turkey were hacked, and other Ministry sites were hacked time to time. Lately we were declared \u201cterrorists\u201d after Ministry of Foreign Affairs was hacked where we have leaked document. All of a sudden cyber teams established against us have mushroomed up. Those couldn\u2019t stop us with help of imperial powers such as USA, EU, Russia or China created \u201ccyber counter-guerrillas\u201d and created sites to vilify us. Also the government, that sees us as terrorists supported these people to attack other countries. They have tried various games to alienate people against us. Very recently attacks started against opposition journalists that makes objective news and lawyers specialises on internet. With the helping hand of the government those fake sites published personal details of these freedom defenders and very harsh/degrading threats were made to them. Just today another dirty \u201ccyber government\u201d attack was made against Birgun (OneDay) newspaper. This must be the very \u201cCyber Army\u201d that was established against us by establishments such as TUBITAK, TIB and BTK. One of their employee quite recently announced that they will use a different approach against us, this must be it.\u00a0 They will brand those fighting for the truth as a terrorist but will unleash their lamers against journalists, lawyers. This must be their so called \u201cdifferent approach\u201d. As these conditions were set by them and freedom defender\u2019s details are published with the help of government, we have taken a decision. Since they are attacking those people fighting for freedom, we will not let them walk alone. Starting from the beginning, we will publish all the leaked documents we have managed to gather, uncensored. We will only stop when they cease to treat these lamers with double standard and treat them as equal as us."},
{"text": "Since we are a \u201cterrorist\u201d and those who publish details of innocent people are heroes, then we will act with the language they understand.\u00a0 We won\u2019t play the inoffensive any longer. The choice is yours; either put the leash on these corrupted lamers that lacks knowledge of code or face the consequences. Lastly, we will not let those take sides with us be alone. We have plenty of jokes and they are funny but they are all real. **We don\u2019t ACQUIT We HACK!****We won\u2019t\u00a0embarrass those trust us and walks with us, we won\u2019t leave them alone halfway through this struggle.\u00a0****If we get arrested one day, we will defend our actions.

A chance to show the locked-down corporate governments of the world that, we the people, are the ones with the real power. Let us turn their technologies against them. Let us make them remember the fifth of November again. Following the small release of all Rainham and Medway Conservative websites admin details yesterday, today it's the turn of the Labour Party. Mr Hain doesn't like it when he's told he can't say what he wants, and neither do we. Unfortunately we have serious doubts about his integrity. Not only was he involved in what amounts to political money laundering, but he was also responsible for allowing Unum and Atos Origins to begin the Great Demolition of the benefits protection for the sick and disabled people of the UK. Despite his blustering against Atos in recent months, there is no doubt that he is a traitor to the people of the United Kingdoms of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Plane loads of people will fly into London from around the world, ANONYMOUS UK will organise coaches from all UK cities and Airports... More than 400 years ago a great citizen wished to invent the 5th of November forever in our memory, his hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest that you allow the 5th of November to pass unmarked, but if you see what we see , If you feel as we feel and if you would seek as we seek then ANONYMOUS ask you to stand beside them, 1 year from tonight outside the gates of parliament and together we shall give them a 5th of November that shall never ever be forgot ..."},

{"text": "SAN JOSE, CA\u2014A federal judge convicted a former Silicon Valley engineer of five counts of theft of trade secrets, United States Attorney Melinda Haag announced. Suibin Zhang was found guilty Monday of three counts of theft and copying of trade secrets for downloading the trade secrets from a secure database, one count of duplication of trade secrets for loading those trade secrets onto a laptop provided by his new employer, and one count of possession of stolen trade secrets. The defendant was acquitted of three counts of computer fraud and one count of unauthorized transmission of a trade secret. The guilty verdict followed a more than two-week bench trial before United States District Court Judge Ronald M. Whyte, which began October 24, 2011 and concluded November 9, 2011. \u201cThe protection of intellectual property rights is of vital importance to the economic security of our region,\u201d United States Attorney Melinda Haag said. \u201cThe investigation and prosecution of thefts of trade secrets remain a significant priority for this office.\u201d Evidence at trial showed that Zhang, 43, of Belmont, California, was employed as a project engineer at Netgear Inc., of San Jose, and had access to the secure database of Marvell Semiconductor Inc. by virtue of his position at Netgear. The evidence further showed that on March 8, 2005, Zhang had accepted a position at Marvell\u2019s chief competitor, Broadcom Corporation, and that, beginning on March 9, 2005, and continuing to March 18, 2005, Zhang used his Netgear account to download and steal trade secret information found in dozens of documents, data sheets, hardware specifications, design guides, functional specifications, application notes, board designs, and other confidential and proprietary items from Marvell. The defendant then loaded the Marvell trade secrets onto a laptop issued by his new employer, Broadcom, on April 27, 2005 and was in possession of those stolen trade secrets on June 24, 2005 when the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed search warrants at his home and at Broadcom. The sentencing of Zhang is scheduled for 9 a.m. on August 27, 2012 before Judge Whyte in San Jose. The maximum statutory penalty for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832 is 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution if the court deems appropriate. However, any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. Zhang has been released by the court on $500,000 bond. Matt Parrella and Dave Callaway are the Assistant U.S. Attorneys who prosecuted the case with the assistance of Legal Tech Nina Burney-Williams. The conviction is the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Both Marvell Semiconductor Inc. and Netgear Inc. cooperated fully with the FBI in the investigation."},

Computer equipment has been seized and is undergoing a detailed forensic examination.\" Team Poison, believed to be behind cyber-attacks on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and the Facebook page of outgoing French President Nicolas Sarkozy, \"has claimed responsibility for more than 1,400 offences\", the statement added. These offences include \"denial of service and network intrusions where personal and private information has been illegally extracted from victims in the UK and around the world,\" police said. Scotland Yard itself came under attack from Team Poison last month, when the group uploaded a four-minute recording of conversations between staff manning Britain's confidential anti-terrorist hotline to YouTube.

{"text": "Greetings fellow citizens of the world, we are AntiS3curityOPS. While this has come to no surprise, the NATO protests are already reaching a boiling point. As tonight we have already witnessed the Chicago Police Dept sending out a request for two water cannons deployed on Michigan Avenue, which the protesters briefly were able to close of the street completely. Just a few moments ago we witnessed cops on horses seemingly all too content with the destiny that has turned their hearts cold, trampling over protesters trying to intimidate. And you know what we saw during this? Protesters locking arms and holding their ground. A few had Anonymous masks' on, a few were girls who looked like they belonged safely off on the sidelines bravely charging cops with shields and on horse. All the while the protesters are chanting \"Take those animals off those horses\", drowning out any attempts by the Chicago police to get a word in. Everyone of you are hero's to us. What we saw tonight watching a bit of the protest was everyday, average people fighting back and finally refusing to stand down. The NATO Summit is being utilized in such a way, and we couldn't have predicted it more accurately. On the video we saw Mother's, teenagers, elderly, the anarchists, white, black, hispanic, this movement see's no skin color. every sort of person is well represented in these actions. This is not a time to have our differences divide us, this is a time we all need to come together and rally around our brother's and sister's bravely in the street's of Chicago risking their lives to make the one voice they have, heard. If every single one of us has a voice, one opinion, let us unite and show the violent Chicago police, and the government big brother tactic's that we are not gonna take this. We are actively engaged in actions against the Chicago Police Deptartment, and encourage anyone to take up the cause and use the AntiS3curityOPS Anonymous banner. For those able, chicagopolice.org should be fired upon as much as possible. We are in your harbor Chicago, and you will not forget us. So for those unable to engage in attacks online by ddos, share with everyone you know what's presently going on in Chicago, Tweet celebrities on twitter with the #SolidarityWithChicago #FuckNATO #FTP hashtags and get it trending. Also keep watching the live feed's, and spreading the live feed links all relevant places. Together, we the people, are gonna take the power back. We are AntiS3curityOPS. We are Anonymous. We are legion. We do not forget. We do not forgive. Chicago Police Deptartment, expect us."},

{"text": "TAMPA, Fla. --\u00a0The State Department has launched a different sort of raid against al-Qaida, engaging in a cat and mouse game to replace anti-American al-Qaida ads on Yemeni tribal websites. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that experts based at the State Department swapped al-Qaida ads on Yemeni websites bragging about killing Americans with ones showing the deadly impact of al-Qaida tactics on Yemenis themselves. \"Our team plastered the same sites with altered versions of the ads that showed the toll al-Qaida attacks have taken on the Yemeni people,\" Clinton said. In response, \"Extremists are publicly venting their frustration and asking supporters not to believe everything they read on the Internet,\" she said. Clinton says the cyber maneuver was launched by an interagency group of specialists, including diplomats, special operators and intelligence analysts, housed at the State Department. Called the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, its experts patrol the Internet and social media to counter al-Qaida's attempts to recruit new followers. \"Together, they will work to pre-empt, discredit and outmaneuver extremist propaganda,\" Clinton said. Rather than hacking the sites covertly, the State Department specialists challenge the extremists in open forums. \"We parody and poke holes in what they do,\" a State Department official explained, in a cyber \"cat and mouse game.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity to because he was not authorized to describe the process publicly. Last week, AQAP launched a new series of banner attack ads focusing on them fighting the Americans, with U.S.-flag-draped coffins, the official explained. The State Department team countered the attack by buying space on the same site with new ads, featuring the coffins of Yemeni civilians. Clinton described the cyber effort as part of a larger, multipronged attack on terrorism that goes beyond attacks like the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden to include the propaganda battle, and the longer, slower campaign of diplomats working alongside special operations troops to shore up local governments and economies and train local forces. Clinton was speaking alongside Adm. Bill McRaven, head of the U.S. Special Operations Command, at a conference of hundreds of U.S. and international special operations commanders - the two senior leaders sending a tacit message to their sometimes warring tribes of troops and diplomats that they have to get along. Yemen is considered both a model and a test case of that effort. U.S. diplomats have been working to stabilize the fledgling government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who replaced ousted Yemeni strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh. Saleh stepped down in February as part of a U.S.-backed power-transfer deal brokered by Gulf Arab countries aimed at ending political unrest in the country after a yearlong uprising. Hadi has faced the twin challenges of Saleh loyalists refusing to relinquish their government and military posts, and of al-Qaida attacks in the south, where the group has established a large safe haven from which to attack Yemeni troops. The White House responded by issuing an executive order last week threatening sanctions against individuals who challenge Hadi's government. It also dispatched a new batch of special operations forces to train Yemen's army to help withstand al-Qaida attacks that have killed hundreds of Yemeni troops. Yemen's al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, is considered one of al-Qaida's most dangerous offshoots. Yemen was the launching pad for three foiled al-Qaida attacks on U.S. targets: the Christmas 2009 attempt to down an American airliner over Detroit with an underwear bomb and the sending of printer cartridges packed with explosives to Chicago-area synagogues in 2010. In the past month the CIA thwarted yet another plot by AQAP to destroy a U.S.-bound airliner using a bomb which could have been undetectable by conventional airport scanners."},

We are currently working to restore normal operations as quickly as possible and will post updates here as they become available here. Initial indications are that the database of our ticketing system may have been compromised, and thus we would recommend that if you have recently sent us a ticket containing your WHMCS or FTP login details, and have not yet changed them again following that, that you do so as soon as possible. As soon as we know more about what happened we'll provide updates. In terms of licensing, providing you have a valid local license key then at this time you should not be experiencing any interuptions in service. If you are doing a new installation or moving your license and thus require a license refresh, these will not be available until the site is back online. Or alternatively if your local key was not valid prior to this downtime, then you may also be experiencing issues validating currently, and once back online do get in touch with us so any local key issues with your installation can be resolved. We would like to offer our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused. We ask you to stick with us \u2013 now more than ever \u2013 in a challenging time. We promise to get everything back to normal soon. UPDATE 18:09 The license checking server is now back online and providing valid license responses. So if you were experiencing licensing errors before, these should now be resolved. Our website and ticket desk should be back online within the next 30-60 minutes. UPDATE 19:20 The main site is now being restored. Those with invalid local keys may experience intermittent license validation issues again. UPDATE 19:55 The main site and ticket system are now back online. UPDATE 20:50 Now our systems have been restored, a status update has been posted here:"},

{"text": "&Dear All, It may be a little early for this post since at this time, our web hosting provider are still investigating and looking into exactly what happened, and why, and are yet to report back to us. But here is what we know at this point in time. A little over 4 hours ago our main server was compromised. This server hosts our main website and WHMCS installation. What we know for sure 1. Our server was compromised by a malicious user that proceeded to delete all files 2. We have lost new orders placed within the previous 17 hours 3. We have lost any tickets or replies submitted within the previous 17 hours What may be at risk 1. The database appears to have been accessed 2. WHMCS.com client area passwords are stored in a hash format (as with all WHMCS installations by default) and so are safe 3. Credit card information although encrypted in the database may be at risk 4. Any support ticket content may be at risk - so if you've recently submitted any login details in tickets to us, and have not yet changed them again following resolution of the ticket, we recommend changing them now. At this time there is still no evidence to suggest that this compromise actually originated through the WHMCS software itself. This was not merely a WHMCS system access, and since we do not provide hosting ourselves, our WHMCS is not hooked up in any way to our server. We would like to offer our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused. We appreciate your support, now more than ever in this challenging time. Once again, we strongly urge all users to cycle all their passwords, not just for WHMCS, but for any associated services that may have been provided to us at any point in time. As soon as we know more, we will post further updates. Matt"},

The internet was created as a tool for human society to use to better each other, and to escape the nightmare of being disconnected. With the internet there is a flow of freedom and information that most governments could not limit even if they had wanted. UGnazi and other entities like it are doing nothing but generating the need for more regulation, thus choking the users of the internet of their freedom.

Further investigations have shown that the social engineering attack did not involve the compromising of any email account. This was only done after access to the server had been gained. We've been working very hard with our web hosting provider to restore and secure services. The DDOS mitigation continues to be ongoing and we are doing everything we can to limit the impact of this. Our main priority until now has been getting our main site back online, secured, and operational, so that we could bring our WHMCS installation back online to open up a route of communication to you, our users, and start dealing with any questions and concerns as quickly as possible. As soon as we have things completely back under control, we will be reviewing all our systems and operating procedures, and making changes as and where appropriate. Steps are already in progress to migrate to a new hosting infrastructure as a first priority. This will likely mean some brief downtime in the coming hours. As I'm sure you can imagine, we are currently receiving a very large number of support tickets and enquiries, and we're doing all we can to answer them as quickly as possible. Your continued patience & support in these testing times is greatly appreciated.

Below you can find some law enforcement related tidbits of info, but if you are willing to stick with us up here for a few minutes we would like to speak on a few things. The reasons for the growth of #anonymous and the flowering of #antisec were no less valid or real on August 16th 2011, the day after Sabu plead guilty in a secret court hearing to various crimes. If anything that event and the events that followed it should be a rallying cry, a clarion call to those who weren't sure what side they were on. The government will chew you up and spit you out, threaten you, turn you against your friends and comrades, lie to you and then shit all over you if they want to. After seeing what happened to LulzSec we shouldn't flinch, we should take a moment to mourn, learn from their errors and redouble our efforts. Hell, if some twitter accounts were to be believed LulzSec is still with us and there were more \"ex-leaders\" of LulzSec than actual members, strange that. We digress.. The people in charge, the \"control machine\" of the Government, the police the corrections system and the intelligence agencies think that the internet is a one way street, information flows from us to them, they are so very wrong. This is a two way street, the only thing between us and you are some wires, ones and zeros. Nobody is untouchable. #antisec is a line in the sand, you cross it and we will respond. You want to steal our privacy, kiss yours good bye. We at k0detec are a little discerning in our choice of targets, primarily law enforcement, government agencies and those who profit from business with cops, militarists and corrupt governments. No Albanian florist shops and no Yoga centers. Fuck unimind unity, but let's at least have enlightened internal non-aggression. Stop the infighting, the d0xing and the squabbling.

{"text": "Today we got\u00a0in touch\u00a0with UGNAZI member @le4ky due to a message that was posted on the main UG twitter account which led the public to start thinking that they was going to be handing themselves over to police for the recent attacks that have happened, but the tweet has now since been removed but you can see a bunch of other tweets that state they are at an end. As part of this interview we have now found out they are not just handing themselves in, but rather not hiding like they was before, but they will also be no longer but like they was before. So here it is, the raw interview with @le4ky (cwn is us, ans is le4kys answer.) CWN - what was it that lead you to the hacking scene? Ans - I have been silently hacking for a few years now, but this censorship issue clearly made me unrest-full, that made me come up and act against the government, not only of US but around the world who supported censorship! CWN - Is your family aware of what has been happening in your cyber life over the past months? Ans - No, My family is totally unaware of what I am doing in my cyber-life. I certainly know that the thing I am doing is illegal so i cant share that with my family! CWN - What was the intention of the hacking you have been involved with? Ans - At first the primary task was to \"DoX\" people supporting censorship, but slowly we turned our attention to big companies that were, in a way supporting the root causes of censorship.We wanted to know them that \"We\" were watching them! CWN - So out of all the attacks you have carried out what are the most memorable ones? Ans - My most memorable one was to hack the comcast one, which is considered the top-most provider of internet connection in US. The comcast hack and WHMCS breach led the FBI to follow us! CWN - Do you ever feel sorry for any of the targets that have been hacked? Ans - No, we were not just randomly hacking websites for fun, there was a cause for every single hack! CWN - Anyway we can confirm which UG members have already faced the courts/police for the actions they have been involved with? Ans - Yeah, actually Josh (@JoshTheGod) had already received a search warrant before and then after WHMCS and Comcast hacks, our all domains were seized and till now"},
{"text": "is redirecting to FBI's website! Josh once posted the pic of the search warrant on his twitter account! CWN - on the UG twitter account it states that the remaining members will be turning them selves in, is this true? Ans - Turning in doesn't mean, we will walk over to the feds, it means we will not hide any more because our team members have decided to stop with our hacks because we havent heard anything for josh yet after the WHMCS hack, where the owner Lodged a complain with the FBI! Evidence -"},
{"text": "CWN - how come the UG members have made the choice to turn themselves in? ans - as I already stated above, we are not giving us to the feds \"yet\". On the other hand we have decided to opt out of public scene for our own safety!"},

On the 25th of may 2012 a 17yo girl from the southern highlands was doing her family a favour and counting their 72yo grand-mothers personal savings, while she was doing this she clearly thought it would be a good idea to take a picture of the cash ( which is an unknown amount) so she\u00a0didn't\u00a0and she posted it on her facebook profile. On the same day at 11.30pm 2 men armed with a knife and bat made way into the house where they thought the money was being kept, by chance this was not the right house, but \u00a0it is the house of the mother of the girl who posted the photo on facebook. Her mother and younger brother who is 14yo was in the house when the 2 armed men gained entry. When they first entered the house they demanded to speak to the girl, which proves this\u00a0is\u00a0purely her fault for being stupid and greedy for posting that picture online. The 2 men went through the house, stole a small amount of cash and left. So really this whole issue could of been avoided if the girl had not wanted to, i guess, seem \"cool\" to her facbook friends for being in contact with a large sum of cash, money is not cool and it is the root of all evil in this world. Police release statement:"},
{"text": "Police warning people to be cautious when using social media after home invasion - Bundanoon Issued at 12.20pm, Monday 28 May 2012 Police have issued a warning to social media users following a home invasion in the Southern Highlands on Thursday. About 4pm on Thursday 24 May 2012, a 17-year-old girl was assisting her 72-year-old grandmother count her personal savings at a residence in Sydney. Whilst counting the money the girl took a photograph of the large sum of cash and posted it on her Facebook page. About 11.30pm on same day, a 47-year-old woman, 58-year-old man and 14-year-old boy were at their home on Teudts Road, Bundanoon. The 47-year-old woman is the mother of the 17-year-old girl. Two men armed with a knife and wooden club allegedly entered the home demanding to speak with the girl about the cash. The woman informed the men that the girl no longer lived at the address. The men searched the house and took a small amount of cash and other personal property before leaving the house. No one was injured during the incident. About 8.30am on Friday 25 May 2012, police from Goulburn Local Area Command were contacted and attended the location. A crime scene was established and examined by investigators. The men were wearing dark-coloured clothing, gloves and had their faces covered. Anyone with information is urged to contact Bowral Police Station on 48629299 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. The incident has prompted police to remind users of social media to take extreme caution when posting photographs and personal information."},

CWN - what was it that lead you to the hacking scene? ans - To fight for the cause of saving the internet. The government is trying to censor the whole internet and our rights, I am not going to just sit here and let them do so, that is why I do what I do and which lead me to the hacking scene. CWN - Is your family aware of what has been happening in your cyber life over the past months? ans - No, i would rather keep it to myself. CWN - What was the intention of the hacking you have been involved with? ans - To help fight the war against the government and censorship. CWN - So out of all the attacks you have carried out what are the most memorable ones? ans - The most memorable hack would have to be the WHMCS Breach and of course the Comcast hack. CWN - Do you ever feel sorry for any of the targets that have been hacked? ans - No, I show no remorse whatsoever for what we do, it is all for a cause. CWN - Anyway we can confirm which UG members have already faced the courts/police for the actions they have been involved with? ans - As of now, there is no confirmed arrests or upcoming court dates for any of us that I know of. CWN - On the UG twitter account it states that the remaining members will be turning them selves in, isthis true? ans - No comment. CWN - how come the UG members have made the choice to turn themselves in? ans - No comment.

In truth, there are more black men in the grip of the criminal-justice system -- in prison, on probation, or on parole -- than were in slavery then. Over all, there are now more people under 'correctional supervision' in America -- more than six million -- than were in the Gulag Archipelago under Stalin at its height.\" -- Adam Gopnik, \"The Caging of America\" One in fifty Americans are now in the grip of some part of the Prison Industrial Complex, either locked up, on parole or probation or being regularly drug tested. Along with the rise in prison population has come the rise of prison as a highly profitable industry. This is big business at it's worst, exploiting prisoners for cheap labour and government cash.

The email claims that he is simply giving us a friendly tip and means no harm. 3. The email divulges absolutely no details that would actually help us determine where the vulnerability is, or how to exploit it for ourselves in order to protect against it. 4. This person wants credit for \"helping\" us. 5. On the 28th, he goes and releases personal information from GR's database on the web. 6.

Note: some have been cleared from the db since the breach, also, most of these won't work on Habbo.com.br because they did a force password change awhile ago. If it doesn't work, try to login via email:) Orozco said, \"This is just the beginning. Don't look at us as some alleged-criminals, we're charmers. We're doing what has to be done.

Yes.

Yes. You can do it too, a webmaster can spend hours, weeks, months, or even years over-analyzing code, but that doesn't mean they're completely safe.

Echelon is currently busy with his own projects on other parts of the world, so i thought i might as well do something to kill some of this boredom. Long story-short, I'm declaring war on China's cyberspace. I've been looking into China's actions in more detail since a couple of months ago and I learned quite a bit about it's constitution, both online and irl. I always knew that it's still very much a communist country, that makes a habit of silencing it's people whenever they disagree with their government, locking them up or worse, but I was never involved directly with this place so I never really cared, but due to unfortunate events and a wanted poster in 4 continents for my head, decided to sail over to south-eastern Asia for a while, and what better place to be than the country that owns the US so hard right now in debt. I just couldn't help myself, but be curious about it. The first thing that I did when I decided to go to war, was to own their cyberpolice. No surprise there, their official site's actually contain the word/s \"cyberpolice\". How dumb is that? Here are a few examples:"},

{"text": "None of them had any useful information on their servers, after doing some research I found out what they really do:"},
{"text": "When you check the info at \"Mainland China\" you get this: \"It has been reported that in 2005, departments of provincial and municipal governments in mainland China began creating teams of Internet commentators from propaganda and police departments and offering them classes in Marxism, propaganda techniques, and the Internet. They are reported to guide discussion on public bulletin boards away from politically sensitive topics by posting opinions anonymously or under false names. Chinese Internet police also erase anti-communist comments and posts pro-government messages. Chinese Communist Party leader Hu Jintao has declared the party's intent to strengthen administration of the online environment and maintain the initiative in online opinion.\" Guess they still haven't learned how to code in different languages. Wonder if they have been taught how to use Word and Excel yet. Oh well, this takes me back from when private investigators and detectives used to get on MySpace to find out their suspects. I suppose a similar thing happens here too, since I've found numerous stories, like for example, how some chinese made yahoo accounts and posted \"anonymously\" on some message boards bad things about the communist ruling party. Newsflash guys, it's called \"trolling\", get with the program. Not sure what's more laughable, that some people somewhere on this planet thought yahoo was anonymous or if those old farts from Mainland China, that rule the commie party, barely know what a keyboard is. This somehow reminds me of that attack on an american satellite, how the chinese apparently hacked into one of them for a couple of minutes by using software from the 70's or something like that. I mean, seriously? Did it take you guys THAT long to breach it? Weak. Though it does sorta explain why 99% of all of their government site's are so outdated, usually with versions below 5, while running on older versions of windows that I never even knew existed. Windows 2003? Windows 2005? Seriously? Meh, winblows anyway. I'll applaud you though, for not investing tax payers money (you cheap bastards) on updated new security systems, that can get breached too, even easier if i may add, but still, isn't some chinese underaged kid somewhere there making ASP servers for 5 cents an hour? Ok, getting a little off-track here, point is, the more I study about this place, the more I get sick. A story popped up while looking into their \"cyberpolice\", thought i'd share. And that is:"},
{"text": "\"On 14 November 2007, Professor Guo Quan published an open letter to Chinese communist leaders Hu Jintao and Wu Bangguo, calling for a \"democratic government based on multi-party elections that serves the interests of the common folks.\" \" What? Democracy?! What is this sorcery? Well, as you can imagine, this didn't sit well with the very serious business commie ruling party of China. In fact the following occurred\u2026 \"Guo's very public open letters to President Hu Jintao demanding multi-party elections and the depoliticisation of the People's Liberation Army, was widely published in internet blogosphere as well as the tradition media. Since then the Chinese cyber-police had begun to black out his blogs.\" Yes, you've read that correctly, the chinese cyberpolice started taking down blogs because a university professor & doctor (PhD) began talking about democracy and his message was so inspiring that it spread like wildfire all over the chinese domains. In 2008, February, he reported and gave an interview to The Times on how his name and work was getting practically removed from google and yahoo cn. What happened to him you might wonder? Oh, you know\u2026 \"On 13 Nov 2008 cnews reported that Guo Quan, was arrested Thursday in the city of Nanjing. According to his wife, the police's charge was \"subversion of state power\" Chinese police routinely uses the charge of \"subversion of state power\"to imprison dissidents for years.\" \"On 17 Oct 2009, Reuters reported that he was sentenced to 10 years in jail.\" Why am I telling you guys this story? Simple. Because, I want everyone to grasp the situation I am putting myself into right now and how big this will be. If a well respected and educated citizen of China got sentenced to a decade in prison simply for expressing his personal feelings about democracy, his own \"free speech\" that many others on this planet take for granted, then imagine how pissed off they'll be for what I'm about to do. ___________________ #ProjectDragonFly will start off with hacked chinese gov, edu and ac domains. Since I'm alone on this operation, I've went and breached every site that was in my way. Most are national site's, but a lot of them are also regional, like Hong Kong (hk), Beijing (bj), Shanghai (sh), Macau (mo), Tianjin (tj), Anhui (ah), etc. The leaks contain from usernames, passwords, addresses, phone numbers, passports, flight numbers, to private messages, project descriptions, and a lot more. I apologize in advance if you will find also names of files, those are the one's that also got shell'd by me, I won't be disclosing those, only raw data for now. This is merely an introduction, after today the real fun will begin. UPDATE* Due to recent events, one of TeamGhostShell's main members, Zoone, was arrested in his country for being involved (ironically) with Anonymous work. I knew he also did some hacktivism, but I never though he'd get caught that way. In this short time, another one of our close friends, the leader behind the @AnonymousChina account was also caught. I was briefed that he was part of another group of greyhats and got raided recently. This made me reconsider my position and leak a bit more than just gov/edu/ac data, but also company information. While sitting on around 800k chinese accounts, i've decided to leak around 100k from different places. The police world-wide got the best of us this time, but now it's time to strike back, therefore I'm bringing to you all, a real cyberwar. Enjoy! _______________________ - In memory of Zoone - He was our main guy that would get us access to different places. From government servers, to random twitter accounts. This was the last batch of goodies he had the chance to give me, I knew he wanted to share these with everyone, so, have fun!"},

{"text": "Hello Mr.Harper, and any passerbys reading this message. In the past few months, the conservatives backed by companies and various people in the House of Commons, have tried to pass a handful of bills that are a disgrace to Canada, and jepordize the security of everyone in the country. Two notable bills are C-11, and C-30; While C-30 was recently announced that it will go back to the drawing board, C-11, and others still remaining ever lasting presence on the battlefield. Much like SOPA in the US which was morphed into the god-awful CISPA, the same will happen to Canada. C-30 will be back under a different name, different ideas, and a different time and place. Oh wait doesn't that already sound familiar? Bill C-51 ring a bell? Maybe it doesn't maybe it does, go look it up and you will see what deceitful plans the Conservatives are up too. Many of these bills have been planned behind the backs of every Canadian. So in response to this, a portion of the internet underground has waited in the dark, breaching your servers, harvesting your data and patiently waiting. Waiting for that moment to strike, and embarass the goverment of Canada. You embarrased your people with these bills, so we embarass you and your security. We are targetting all organizations belonging to the Canadian government that we can get our hands on. This includes websites belonging to military, government, and educational organizations all across Canada. This is not a joke, you will see that we are serious. So, without staling any further and try to come up with some more vague political jibber jabber, I present to you, the Holy Lulz Crusade of Canada. What is this you may ask? Well it is quite simple, it is a Crusade in search of laughter, good times, and to spread a message. And most importantly, to cause some good ol' fashion chaos, internet style :D Great lulz were derived from the pitiful security of webservers belonging to the canadian government and different universities around the country. This is not a single man project, I am joined by my fellow crew members to complete this epic quest. They were Sp3ctrum10, Ichi, Th1nkT0k3n, and M4D_D4SH. Without them this would not have been possible at all! So a massive amount of kudos, props, and thanks goes to them. Everyone worked hard and we got shit done. I would also like to give a shoutout to the rest of Team Digi7al, you da best :D I hope you enjoy looking at this data as much as we enjoyed getting it. Enjoy!

Do you want to cry? Did we rustle your jimmies? 4chan.org is the playground that allows pedophiles to share their \"collections\" and the disgusting bronies to hang out. The site is loosely monitored and child porn threads are allowed to \"stay alive\" for an exceedingly long amount of time. Shocking seeing as there is a stick policy against posting it. As for the bronies, these rainbow, unicorn, free to be you and me tards are despicable. The more there is opposition against them, the more they tried to ram the rainbow down people's throats. We simply decided to fight back, which is a natural tendency for any person. For the people that just still can't seem to understand and are wiping away their tears as they read this: prove your age and maybe you will have a leg to stand on. Minors are allowed to access the site without their age actually being confirmed. You don't play by the rules, neither will we. To those who have requested this attack and even tried and failed themselves: you are welcome. We were the chemo that so many have requested to purge that cancerous site. Lastly, there was no political motive here, we will not tell lies and pretend that it was all to fight an injustice. This was for the lulz. This was for the fame. This was done because only we have the skill to do it. This was done, so that we can laugh at your butthurt. We did it because we can. \"If we all did the things we are capable of, we would astound ourselves.\" ~Thomas A Ediso"},

Other places that stick into my mind right now are Skylab/s, got access to random EU official servers, like directly from the browser, admin/password and got their bases from the outside, one of IBM's search servers for bank accounts, and a whole of other stuff, BBC (their news domain), a russian military site, still not sure up to this day what I found in there, but plenty of data, those people are fucking crazy - war crazy. Banks, airports, pissed off a cartel in South America. Threatened to publish some of their people's names. Kept bragging how I was going to make Facebook accounts with their names and pictures and post how they're planning on going to Disneyland together. One of them found me in a chat one day and told me that if I do something stupid he's going to make me another smile right under the first one. Aaah, good times. I'd say more, but you probably won't believe me."},

{"text": "Again no. I may be a blackhat right now, but I've never stolen a penny in my life from any of the accounts I've hacked, in fact last year I busted my ass off and worked for someone's server for a couple of months non-stop, white-nights. Did for him work of tens of thousands of dollars, paid me like a grand (lol, cheap bastard), and after I finished the work, he fired me. I'm surprised up to this day why I never just made some off-shore accounts and wired some of the money from the banks i've hacked. I should be chillin' right now in Costa Rica with 5 bitches. Oh & the so called \"sensitive information\" that I've posted isn't all that hardcore anyway. Names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.? Seriously? That's sensitive? I might as well get a phone book and start copy/pasting if that's what gets people hard. When I post things like these, I do it to make a statement, that I've been in that specific place and that I had access to everything. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm constantly challenging myself to get better."},

I used to hang out with them, then Echelon came one day to me with the Chinese Uni. After that, I started to get more interested in the place, so I thought I'd do some research on it. When I saw how fucked up China truly is, I made a call. I knew I was already wanted in the west, so I decided to move my attacks over to Asia. And what better place, than China. The whole image on how they put in jail everyone that tries to go against the Communist Party, made me sick. So much for free speech. Their cyberpolice is so pathetic as well so this whole war should be a piece of cake considering how most of their security is from the 90's. I might write a paper on it in the near future, describing their usual security, their flaws, the differences between them and other countries, how you can prepare more if you plan on breaching their servers and so on. I started out this war without knowing anything, now I've gathered quite a bit of intel on them. It wouldn't hurt to share some of the knowledge."},

{"text": ". This morning a hacker was able to access a customer's account on CloudFlare and change that customer's DNS records. The attack was the result a compromise of Google's account security procedures that allowed the hacker to eventually access to my CloudFlare.com email addresses, which runs on Google Apps. While we are still working with Google to investigate the details, we wanted to highlight it here to make people aware that they too may be vulnerable to similar attacks and provide a full accounting of what happened."},
{"text": "This attack appears to have begun in mid-May. It appears an account request was sent to Gmail for my personal email address. Google's procedure asks for a number of questions to attempt to verify account ownership. We're not clear on how the process works, but it appears that weeks after the process was initiated, the hacker somehow convinced Google's account recovery systems to add a fraudulent recovery email address to my personal Gmail account. The password used on my personal Gmail account was 20+ characters long, highly random, and not used by me on any other services so it's unlikely it was dictionary attacked or guessed. Once the recovery email address was added, the hacker could then reinitiate the password recovery process and get reset instructions sent to the fraudulent email address. Those instructions were then used to reset my personal email this morning."},
{"text": "Like thousands of other companies, CloudFlare uses Google Apps for email. When we first established CloudFlare.com's email address, I listed my personal email address as a recovery email for my account. The hacker was able to use Google's password recovery and have the password reset sent to my personal email for my CloudFlare.com address. Surprisingly, all CloudFlare.com accounts use two-factor authentication. We are still working with Google to understand how the hacker was able to reset the password without providing a valid two-factor authentication token. Once the attacker had access to my CloudFlare.com email account, the hacker was able to access our Google Apps administrative panel. The hacker appears to have targeted a particular customer, and initiated a password reset request for the customer's CloudFlare.com account. We sent a copy of these requests to an administrative email account for debugging purposes and, ironically, to watch for invalid password reset requests. The hacker was able to access this account in Google Apps and verify the password reset. At that point, the attacker was able to log into the customer's CloudFlare account and change DNS settings to temporarily redirect the site."},
{"text": "We were aware of the incident immediately. We have senior contacts at Google who we worked with in order to regain control of the Google Apps accounts (both my personal Gmail account and my CloudFlare.com account). We were able to revert the change to the customer's account. We manually reviewed all other password reset requests and DNS changes. There were no other CloudFlare.com accounts that were accessed or altered. To ensure that no other accounts can be compromised, we have invalidated all the password reset logs. We have also removed copies of password reset requests from being set to any administrative email accounts in case our Google Apps account is compromised in the future. From our investigations, it appears that at no time was our database accessed or any additional client data exposed. It appears this was, in effect, a very elaborate and sophisticated attack targeting one particular customer's login information."},
{"text": "My personal email address has been removed from any association with CloudFlare. I've also added two-factor authentication to my personal Gmail account -- something that this incident highlights the importance of. I would recommend if you are using Gmail or Google apps, you take the following steps as soon as possible:"},
{"text": "The final puzzle we don't yet know the answer to is how the hacker was able to bypass Google's two-factor authentication on CloudFlare.com email address. That is troubling. That should have prevented this attack, even if the attacker had the password, so it remains concerning to us that it did not. We are working with Google to understand how two-factor authentication was disabled. As we learn more, we'll update this post. **Update (Saturday, June 2, 2012, 7:40 GMT):\u00a0**Just received notice from Google that they tracked down the issue core issue that allowed a compromise of the two-factor authentication system. Google reports that they discovered a \"subtle flaw affecting not 2-step verification itself, but the account recovery flow for some accounts. We've now blocked that attack vector to prevent further abuse.\" That's great news. I want to reiterate that the Google Security team has, at all times throughout this incident, been responsive and attentive to the issue. In my opinion, they are the model of security on the Internet and we continue to trust them to power email for CloudFlare.com."},

A: I'm not in it for treason or pedestrianizing millions around the world, I'm solely in it because Computer Security is the most fitful outlet for me. Nowadays, the Hacking community is motile. There's hundreds of group who are hostile and make freedom-ring by indulging in illegal matters and leaking information on Websites to industrialize themselves within the scene. Q: Lets be clear, are you a White Hat or a Black Hat? A: I'd consider myself a Grey Hat. I use to run around like Rambo with my underwear strapped to my back publicizing private information but that isn't the case now, it's a matter of taste, my friends. No matter what we do in this era, the Government will always look at us as some heavily-reigned criminals. I'm one who's swallowed that and accepted it. Thing is though, our Government is far more monomaniac then us. Think of it like that when you're in custody, my kids. Let's go! Amongst those affected include: [+] www.durdans.com [+] www.sunetra.org [+] Security Issue => Hospital Management System [+] Vulnerability => Software Vulnerability. Application setup is dreadful. Systematically, they gather together Hospital records and form it into one, easily accessible but hard to target because what's in the application itself, only the Administrator can see as nothing is remote and nothing is channeled throughout the stream. [+] Risk Potential => Thousands of inpatients and outpatients affected. Payment and Billing info also at risk. [+] Miscellaneous => I had access to the source code. I had a high-end when it came to exploiting it. I connected to the Software, studied it, and saw that it was making foreign connections outside its jurisdiction. Furthermore, I connected to it remotely using the username, \"emp0001\", and password, \"admin\" - w00t! root. I've yet to report the matter to those who created the dreadful piece of software. I plan on calling them later this afternoon. Pictures:"},
{"text": ""},
{"text": "[+] Solution => The Data circuit can be defected even if you were to patch the Software Vulnerabilities. I'd recommend dismantling the Sub Connection it reads the data from and perhaps even making some mild changes to the hosting you've got. Application reads from Database => Pulls information that's requested => Attacker now has the ability to do whatever the fuck he wishes. Fix is mildly simple. Thanks!"},

Wrong mofo, you call up SwaggSec and tell 'em to hack China Telecom. We own their asses. And know what they do, when we leave them a little message? Nothing, they don' tell anyone. They just move their shitty SQL serva' and preten' it's all over. But with SwaggSec it's never over. We give 'em the taste of the people, the people they don' care about. And it's funny, now what's going to happen? All their passwords in the hands of the people they don' care about? What do you is gonna' happen? We gonna' laugh as we end them once and for all. Oh and we don' stop with one hack, they have a slow ass serva' anyways. We hacked Warner Bros too. Not just some lil' webserver, we hack the whole intranet. We see how they work and all. Funny thing, is that Warner Bros' IT knew about the hacks, according to their data and did nothing. They don' give a shit. Now they gonna' get their ass owned. Hacking China Telecom, was as simple as we assumed it would be. As BBC reported, China and Brazil are the most vulnerable to a cyber attack. I assume China neglected the international news source's article. China Telecom's SQL server had an extremely low processing capacity, and with us being impatient, after about a month straight of downloading, we stopped. However, a few times we accidentally DDoS'd their SQL server. I guess they thought nothing of it, until we left them a little message signed by SwaggSec. They realized they were hacked, and simply moved their SQL server. No changing of admin passwords, or alerting the media. At any moment, we could have and still could destroy their communication infrastructure leaving millions without communication. Warner Bros' also approaches the same technique of confidentiality and ignorance when it comes to their own security vulnerabilities. When we hacked their intranet, we were surprised to see their IT department's well documented \"confidential\" data about the \"critical vulnerabilities\" on their servers and sites. However, their IT department's ignorance to fix any of the vulnerabilities they were aware about, granted us complete access to their servers. Although we were going to include a much larger leak from Warner Bros, we decided to stick within our time frame in hand. Besides, there are plenty of other ignorant companies to own. In the torrent below, you will find over 900 admin users for China Telecom. The login for this resides at"},

The torrent also contains a more in depth statement about China Telecom, and all their databases and tables.

Today we had the chance to ask them a few questions regarding their history and the attacks and targets they have chosen recently. Interview: Q: How long have you been using computers for? A: I'm using computer for last 13 year's. I\u00a0started\u00a0with a Pentium I. There was installed a few little games, but the most of time a was learning programming. I started to learn Pascal/Delphi and Assembler. After a year I started to learn C/C++ and I love this language. My first malware was written on C++. Also I started to learn HTML. After a few year's I bought a new Pentium III. I started to learn PHP/MySQL, javascript. Started to exploit sql injection's and XSS/LFI. Now I have a few server's that are mine and a lot of dedicated servers. Q: What was the interest in website/server exploration? A: I always was interested in how secure are big web portals, company's websites. How to hack an email... A few years ago I found an sqli in an online store, I found myself\u00a0exploiting it\u00a0. There was a huge list of credit cards. A I found a lot of emails with sensitive data (docs, photo's, fails, audio/video). I love hacking and nobody can stop me at the moment. Q: which is most suit to you black/grey/white hat? A: I prefer to be a grey hat. I can hack a website and destroy it, but also I can contact the admin and give him a report about vuln's on his site. After I hack a website a expose some server data and some database info for PoC. In rare times I can expose some personal data. Q: Do you ever feel sorry for innocent bystanders from cyber attacks? A: I never feel sorry. If you are a hacker victim, ask your self about how strong was the email password or ask the site admin, why he is so stupid and lazy. Q: What age group are you within below 20, 20-30, 30+? A: I'm 24 year's old. Q: is your family friends aware of what you do online? A: I don't tell my family about my online life. I have just a few friends who know's what I can do. Q: The targets you have been going for recently seem to be fairly random besides the\u00a0petroleum\u00a0targets. is there any particular reason for all these recent attacks? A: In\u00a0January\u00a0I\u00a0started\u00a0with some\u00a0African\u00a0stock exchange market (Ghana, Botswana etc.) Then I thought it will be good to check bank secure systems. The result - a lot of Ghana bank's hacked and data leaked. After this I started to hack bank sites from all over the world. Also last year I was looking how LulzSec is targeting it's the SONY website's and the fed's. Anonymous and LulzSec inspired me to do what I do. Simple hack's are not so interested like bank's or big company's. Why? It's simple to find vuln's but it's not so simple to exploit this vulns. Q: We have noticed a hike a in #opitaly tagged attacks, is there any further information what this op is about? A: At the moment there are just a few hack's and a few more will be exposed soon. I don't think that it will result a big attack. I'm a single hacker and it's\u00a0they\u00a0hard for me to keep all this attack's. But, after some hack's we'll see pluses and minuses of this attack's and maybe Anonymous Italy will help me. Q: Do you have any plans for big targets or attacks coming up? A: Yes, there some targets, but this is a surprise. How I told earlier, I'm a single hacker and I need much more time for one attack. But this hack's will be a very good lesson for big company's, FED's, government and all those who wanna censore us. P.S. The only message to them - We Are Anonymous. We Are Legion. We Do Not Forgive. We Do Not Forget. You Should Expect Us!"},

You can have the pleasure of sharing seats with targets such as WallStreet, CIA Services, MIT, Consulting Firms, Political Advisors, Security Companies, Corporations, Weapon's Dealers, Laboratories, Internet Hosting Services, Academics, Banks, Police Departments, Aviation, The Navy, Stocks Exchange, Bonds Exchange, Markets, Emirates Organizations, Various Businesses, Hedge Funds, Estate Agencies, Public Affairs, Robotics, etc. Team GhostShell's final form of protest this summer against the banks, politicians and for all the fallen hackers this year. With the help of it's sub-divisions, MidasBank & the newest branch, OphiusLab. One million accounts/records leaked. We are also letting everyone know that more releases, collaborations with Anonymous and other, plus two more projects are still scheduled for this fall and winter. It's only the beginning. To conclude this summer's hacking spree, I will be giving away to anyone who's up for the challenge three different access points to three different groups/crews out there. It's our way of saying how great it's been raiding with you and let's hope that it isn't over just yet. The access-points are the following: 1. Six billion databases from a chinese mainframe full of chinese & japanese technology. It's very possible that it has from other countries as well, we haven't checked them all for obvious reasons. 2. Over 105 billion databases to a US stockexchange mainframe/s. It's very possible that the actual number is over 1 trillion, I wasn't prepared the first time and it gave me a memory error after 105 when it tried to add another digit. This job will require you to have at least 1TB available. 3. Access-points to 3-4 different servers belonging to the Department of Homeland Security. The sensitive information isn't that great but it may be good for street cred. Ok, that's all. Whoever wants any of them, you can contact me at voxanon. (make sure my nick is registered, there are many impostors out there). Oh, and people have kept asking me about the WallStreet hack from MidasBank.

{"text": "By now, many of you have read recent headlines reporting that 6.5 million LinkedIn hashed passwords were stolen and published on an unauthorized website. We take this criminal activity very seriously so we are working closely with the FBI as they aggressively pursue the perpetrators of this crime. As you may have heard, there have been reports of other websites that have suffered similar thefts. We want to be as transparent as possible while at the same time preserving the security of our members without jeopardizing the ongoing investigation. In this post, we want to address questions we\u2019ve been receiving and share what we\u2019ve learned so far about the incident, how we\u2019ve responded, and what we\u2019re doing to protect our members going forward. First, it\u2019s important to know that compromised passwords were not published with corresponding email logins. At the time they were initially published, the vast majority of those passwords remained hashed, i.e. encoded, but unfortunately a subset of the passwords was decoded. Again, we are not aware of any member information being published at any time in connection with the list of stolen passwords. The only information published was the passwords themselves. Here are the most common questions we are being asked by our members:"},
{"text": "Thus far, we have no reports of member accounts being breached as a result of the stolen passwords. Based on our investigation, all member passwords that we believe to be at risk have been disabled."},
{"text": "As soon as we learned of the theft, we launched an investigation to confirm that the passwords were LinkedIn member passwords. Once confirmed, we immediately began to address the risk to our members, prioritized as follows: Based on our investigation, those members whom we believed were at risk, and whose decoded passwords already had been published, had their passwords quickly disabled and were sent an email by the Customer Service team. By the end of Thursday, all passwords on the published list that we believed created risk for our members, based on our investigation, had been disabled. This is true, regardless of whether or not the passwords were decoded. After we disabled the passwords, we contacted members with instructions on how to reset their passwords."},

{"text": ".

That transition was completed prior to news of the password theft breaking on Wednesday. We continue to execute on our security roadmap, and we\u2019ll be releasing additional enhancements to better protect our members."},

The UN trial of 2001 about congo's war in 1998 showed that the conflict was a fight to control Congo's coltan mines. Firms like Apple, Intel, IBM, Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, etc... use great amounts of coltan in order to produce computers and cellular phones.We know that also in 1998 intel used lots of coltan,and that coltan comes from Congo. So we can say that intel contibutes indirectly to create the Congo's war in 1998.During Congo's coltan war 6 milion people lost their lives.We also know that,now,mininig companies that provide coltan to intel,are working in Congo.In 2012 a new civil war in growing up in Kivu.Kivu is Congo's region which has lots of coltan mines. The war of 2012 is by mr.Ntaganda and this army, formerly involved in 1998 war.So,now,there's war in Congo and namely Congo is not a war free area.Intel says that from 2013 its coltan will come from conflict-free areas.So we ask to Intel: where do you take your coltan from 1999 to 2012? Why have not you developed a sustitute for coltan in this last 13 years? Pristine ecosystems where destroyed in order to extract coltan and also lots of gorillas were killed. Coltan in digged whith bare hands in hinumane condition by cogolese people. Children usually dont'go school in order to dig the mineral.Coltan is also quite radioactive and miners has terrible healt problems. For Intel, desploiting Congo's people and devasting Nature in cheeper than develop new war- free thecnologies. We underline that also in 2011 Intel promise to stop immidiately to use Congo's minerals.This never occours.So in 2012 Intel promises another time,to produce conflict free processors from 2013.Also Traxys substain that from 8 maj 2012 its minerals would come from conflict free areas,but we shows that Traxys is laying.This is prooved by \"salvakalumba\"'s mail in Traxy's dumped db.So great firms are completely unaffordable,they are only interested in making money. We speak to every human being , if reading about the atrocities of intel Traxys...you feel pain in your heart, now you can contribute to sort out the truth.

{"text": "to TRAXYS firm. We know that now a civil war is going on in Congo. So Congo surely isn't a war-free area. Ovbiously no one should desploit countries during a civil war so, as explained in the following mail, the lead ore in rapidly taken to Zambia, so noone can proove that the ore is digged in Congo.The aforementioned civil war, is due to mr. Ntaganda, a war-lord formerly involved in the war in Congo of 1993. RAID, which is an organization or the english government, and also UN, demonstrated that the war in 1993 was a war for coltan.Congo, which is now troubled by another civil war, is also reach of many other minerals different from coltan, e.g. lead ore.Whit this mail mr salvakalumba is triyng to sell lead ore from Congo to Traxis. So that leak shows that firms are digging and selling minerals from Congo. Further more, TRAXYS declarate, on 8 May 2012 that the sourcing of minerals from Democratic Republic of East-Congo is suspended in order to to protect its reputation from any appearance of wrongdoing. This mail shows that declaration is false, TRAXYS is clearly interested in Congo's lead ore. For this reason \"salvakalumba\" move the lead ore digged in Congo to Zambia so no one can proove that the lead ore is digged in Congo. This permit TRAXYS to say that they realy believe that the lead ore is from Zambia and not from Congo. We know that, in Congo, miners suffer terrible work conditions and nature is destroied in order to extract ore. From 2012 another civil war is growing up in Congo.Great companies dont'care to all this things, they continue to dig devast Congo's Nature forcing congo's people in war and slavery!"},

Joshua Hicks was a great kid and I'm truly saddened that he partook a role in all this, he was like any modern-day teen; partying, fucking around, etc. But his past bit him in the ass. Mir Islam was amongst those affected by the Sting Operation and he was also the leader of @UGNazi. He got released on a $50,000 bond.

I won't go into specifics but you know who you are and I know that you're reading this with your hands tied thinking, \"Fuck, I wish it didn't come to this.\" - If you want honesty, I'll give you honesty. You're a crook who accepted the criminal lifestyle but not the consequences that came with it. You're just like any modern-day Joe Blow.

New 'groups' are emerging, more 'pigments' are being infiltrated by demented teenagers so they could feel better about themselves, etc. My demands are written on the palm of my hands; stop. You're a nuisance. Sliding back to the whole Trendmicro & Sykes testament, we don't want to be compete pricks, so for the companies' sake, we'll take baby steps on this one.

We were able to immediately fix the hole and upgraded our hashing mechanisms from sha-256 with random salts to bcrypt to fortify security. \u00a0We take this matter very seriously and continue to review our internal security policies and practices to help ensure that this never happens again. We wanted to provide feedback to questions we are seeing come through our support desk: - If you have not yet received an email asking you to reset your password, make sure you are checking the email account of the email you registered with on Formspring. \u00a0Also check your Spam folder. \u00a0If you still don\u2019t see the email or no longer have access to that email address, contact our support team at"},

According to Palestine News Network,Nakba demonstrations are expected to take place all over the West Bank, Al-Quds, Gaza and the countries across the world.Fearing the possible massive gatherings of the Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories, the Israeli forces have adopted tough security measures ahead of the Nakba Day protests and arrested several Palestines."},

Today the\u00a0Australian federal police have now confirmed that 6 youths from\u00a0Sydney,\u00a0Brisbane\u00a0and\u00a0Perth\u00a0have been issued warnings over suspicious online activities. Now this is how it should be done, we look over at America and united kingdom and they tend to arrest and charge anyone that has committed cyber offences, but here in Australia our police are attempting to educate them into the trouble that may arise from participating in such activities."},
{"text": "The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has issued six cautions to young people suspected to be engaging in cybercrime related activities in the past week. Throughout June, AFP officers attended residences in Brisbane, Sydney and Perth in relation to suspicious online activity. The individuals and their parents or guardians were each provided with a copy of the relevant Commonwealth legislation and educated as to the illegality or potential illegality of their activities. National Manager High Tech Crime Operations Neil Gaughan said this is a reminder of the AFP\u2019s vigilance in the cyber environment. \u201cThese activities are just part of the ongoing commitment by law enforcement to deter cyber criminals,\u201d Assistant Commissioner Gaughan said. \u201cIn this case, the AFP has engaged with these young people to educate them on the risks of becoming involved in this type of behaviour before they find themselves committing serious offences. Activities such as hacking, creating or propagating malicious viruses or participating in DDOS attacks are not harmless fun. They can result in serious long-term consequences, such as criminal convictions and perhaps jail time. The AFP has not arrested any of the young people spoken to. This activity was undertaken as a deterrence measure and to increase their understanding of these types of offences.\u201d Under Commonwealth legislation, hacking and computer related offences carry penalties between two to 10 years imprisonment. The AFP is dedicated to preventing all Australians from becoming victims of cyber related crime by empowering them to use technology safely and responsibly. ThinkUKnow Australia is a partnership between the AFP and Microsoft, and supported by ninemsn and Datacom, promoting the safe and responsible use of technology. The ThinkUKnow initiative aims to educate children, parents, carers and teachers about the risks faced online and how to create a safe online experience for young people.

Because FoxNews Does not want this to go public nor do they want anyone to know about it 1. If Global corperations saw FoxNews was internally hacked - The devastation on that is just out right crazy - the impact this can have on the media or just in general is Astronomical. I find it funny how LulzSec attacked FoxNews - What all could they do? Not a godam thing except phish some fucked up News Reporter's Twitter account..................... I mean come on guys if that doesnt show you the reality of lulzSec then i dont know what else will With that said Below is FoxNews Channel Internally Hacked 1. FoxNews Channel - Terestrial land Based Distribution Hub Relay What is a Terestrial land Based Distribution Hub ? land based signals received through a conventional aerial communication systems When you go to FoxNews on your local TV and you see these ad's - Companies aka Affiliates go to this Special system to upload there own Videos When they upload the video ( there Companies Commercial ) its set in the pump que - Then you got your Edge Employee's that Push it out FoxNews Has over 200+ of these systems During my analyasis on the Service i was able to identify a Vulnerability in the SOFTWARE its self therefore allowing the use of ALL FOX NEWS Teestrial Land Based Distribution Hubs 2. FoxNews DG - HD Distributer What is the DG - HD Distributer? Spot Box HD Xtreme is the cornerstone of DG FastChannel\u2019s HD Xtreme\u2122 initiative, an end-to-end electronic video distribution solution equipping advertisers and broadcasters with a complete and robust solution for the distribution and management of HD advertisements.

All the pictures you need to comfirm this is in the pictures.zip folder 3. FoxNews Steam Control - The application that controls the LiveSteam on FoxNews Website - Proof of Concept = Look at the Pictures 4. FoxNews - Comtrol Network serial converter look up Comtrol Network serial converter - TO see what the software is and how that can you you an idea as to what i was able to do with Fox Systems I dont want to go into a lot of great detail because i dont want to put out to much information that could possibly hurt FoxNews other then this embarrsemnt with that said all the pictures you need to validate everything is in the link below Time Line: Contacted Someone - That guy called Director of Cyber Esponiage ( FBI ) Parent Company of FoxNews Calls FoxNews FoxNews Information Technology Team + Parent company of FoxNews Information technology E-mail me I Sent my audit report to them And they are now fixing the Vulnerabilities and everything else. I wish i didnt have to come out public like this in this way as trust me i had a much more funnier way as to how i wanted to inform you guys of this hack with the Reporter But since stuff has changed quickly i have to react fast - But none the less nothing was damaged - im not getting charged for anything - and i might even land a job with there IT team who knows Anyways to give you guys a summary of the Potential danger in this Ever saw the movie Hackers? Know how the guy was able to control the TV station and watch whatever he wants? Well thats pretty much what this is - except i never changed the TV lol There might be a news report sometime in the near future but honestly i just dont see it happening anymore - With that said stay tuned for more ====================================== DOWNLOAD ->"},

As some of you may know (although not nearly as many as it should be), Europe has these past few years been hit by waves of extreme-right nationalism and racism in it\u00b4s political sphere.

The parties thrive on ignorance and disappointment, and have risen towards power on the wave that was the 2008 economic crisis - just as the NSDAP did during the 30s. #TeamGhostShell are starting #ProjectWestWind, which includes attacks on European government servers as well as bringing these events to the surface.

(from the movie \" The Working Class Goes to Heaven \") The ruthless logic of profit compels us to work to survive, and this in itself is inhumane, but no one can ask a human being to work to die. No one may use a person as a pawn to put pressure on policy in order to increase the profit. We know, and you know, like the Ilva steelworks cause terrible diseases. Let's look around: the municipal, provincial and regional left Taranto, are transforming the city into an open dump. In a few years 4 incinerators have been built. What future can we have in these conditions? WORKER! No one is morally entitled to ask you to sacrifice your life, not even your wife or your children. No ideal or material need is your existence. Workers, occupy the factory and sabotage every system! Ilva of Taranto is nothing but a camp that ravages the environment and affect the right to life. Forcing a man to choose between the salary and health is not only a deplorable blackmail, but also a very serious infringement of the right of every person to exercise a profession in compliance with the regulations (relating to occupational safety and environmental protection). We feel offended as People First: many workers risk their lives every day, poisoned by 'high toxicity of these places, to bring home a meager salary. We are strongly indignant as Citizens: this company does not care at all of its employees and does not put in place strategies and protocols to protect them. Workers! Opposite to the blackmail of those who force you to choose between the right to life and lowest salary the only sensible choice is to fight because at least every citizen, whether working or not having a monthly allowance that allows them to live in dignity. Every human being by the very existence is entitled to all the means necessary to its life and development of his personality. see the new declaration of human rights and animal ecosystem ("},
{"text": ") # DeclarationChan As can be seen the so-called \" ethical code \"of the company, the health protection is not only a duty but also an undeniable priority, as well as an inviolable right. Here are some excerpts from the document: 2.1 DIGNITY, HEALTH, SAFETY AT WORK AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY: The Company protects the dignity, health and safety at work, through the application of all laws in force. The Company, having distinguished itself in the protection of human health and environmental protection, promotes and protects the health of their employees. 7.1.2 RELATIONSHIP TO HEALTH CARE: The company undertakes in order to protect the health of 'environment in which it operates, to conform their behavior to the health regulations and / or environmental regulations. In this regard, the Company confirms its commitment in accordance with directives issued by the competent local and national health authorities, a transparent and collaborative relationship with the authorities in the health sector is a guiding principle in developing its industrial and commercial programs. As is mentioned above These rights of protection to workers should be respected because it conform to the standards imposed by the company itself. Instead, as many testimonies and convictions suffered by the company confirmed, none of this exists: the story of Ilva is the story of a factory constantly manipulated by the claws of those who wage trades with poison to fatten their pockets. Already in 1982, the Director of the then Italsider suffered a conviction for \"jet of dust\"; twenty years later, the mogul Emilio Riva is convicted of the so-called \"mineral parks\", with a charge of dangerous things and jet violation of Article 13 of the PDR 203-244 in May 1988 and in 2007, the same Emilio Riva is convicted of extortion (blackmail employment) and Morris (INPS through the collection of contributions from the mobility assumptions), and both he and his son Claudio are banned from activities industry. We are faced with a lack of humanity and responsibility by those employers. The workers are forced to endless rounds, treated almost like animals, condemned to give up health. Respect and protection for the person must be a priority, not an optional extra. The culprits have poisoned the minds and bodies of those who were forced to live to work; have clipped the wings of employment sectors that would otherwise have found a luxuriant growth; have forced the inhabitants of a 'whole city to breathe the toxic accumulation of capital contemptuous of human rights. We are close to the families of those who has died, poisoned by the vile thirst unconditional profiteers. We are close to those who still struggle to survive and drag her illness every day, put back to the wall by a state which covers its dirty conscience with meager compensation, and behind the scenes tightens shady agreements with the owners. despise the work of those who, with their tentacles, has bestowed blackmail working and riding arrangements and derogations sown lies behind the laws on emissions: cashing in on the skin of Citizens, hiding behind bureaucracy and memoranda of understanding, is a form of legalized crime."},

{"text": "Federal Police have issued a stern warning to computer hackers who have been trying to crash Australian government websites. Hacking movement Anonymous has been credited with infiltrating government and company websites across the world, and now members of the group have set their sights on Australia. Acting under the banner of the Anonymous movement, hackers yesterday unsuccessfully tried to bring down the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Defence Signals Directorate websites. Both agencies say their websites have not been infiltrated and they do not store classified information there. Federal Police are warning hacking-related offences can carry a jail term of up to 10 years. \"The difficulty is finding this loosely-based group who advertise their activism online but have been notoriously difficult to pin down in person,\" a spokesperson said. Anonymous says the hacking aims to protest against the Federal Government's plans for surveillance powers it claims would allow more personal details to be stored on web servers. The group is already facing a police investigation into allegations its members have taken 40 gigabytes of confidential customer data from AAPT, one of Australia's biggest phone companies."},

{"text": "========== Dear readers, Well, I give up. Honest to God, this is the end of my hacking/anonymous days. I just can't take it anymore. I fight for what i believe should be done, and there are other \"anonymous\" people saying that i shouldn't. They say that Anonymous doesn't give two shits about whaling. Well I do. I am Anonymous and i am against whaling, does that mean i shouldn't fight to stop it? Well if you were one of the people that said i shouldn't be wasting my time with whaling, i do not call you Anonymous. I call you stupid and ignorant. Never tell someone they can't fight for their beliefs. To the Faroe Islands residents, i am sorry if you got caught up in all this. I am still opposed to whaling, but i would like to apologize for what i've done to your small yet traditional community. (A lot of you also requested a written apology, well here you go.) I hope that you all get back into your daily routine, and that you, in time, stop whaling. You won't i know, but it feels better to hope for an end of it. I am sorry for all the trouble i have caused, and pray for your forgiveness. Same with all those other Scandinavian people who were offended by what i did. If you were compromised during this event, i am deeply sorry for it. If your website was hacked, i hope you also plan to patch the SQL injectable holes in your websites, so no one else gives you any trouble. I have deleted the leaked data, the dox will remain because it is not my work, and it is entirely legal. To the Prime minister of the Faroe Islands, if you ever see this, i apologize in general to your nation, i am aware whaling is legal in your country. To the people who wasted hours of their lives arguing with me, i hope you're happy and proud, because you won. From here i will go back to the old days when i used to enjoy programming. But believe me when i say i hacked for more reasons than activism. To me hacking was an anti-depressant, and was addictive at times. I do it at school, at home, whenever i have the opportunity i am picking out SQL injectable targets and exploiting them, but i'm stopping as of tonight. It's hazardous to my health anyway i suppose. To any police/security agencies watching me, i apologize for my actions and all the damage they have done. To the other people working with me on #OpHarpoon, i'm sorry for abandoning you like this. At least i got you all the media attention you needed, but you will have to find yourselves another willing hacker. Also to everyone that didn't know, I AM NOT LEADING #OpHarpoon. I am merely the hacker in all this, i didn't choose the Faroe Islands as a target, i didn't choose whalers as a target, i did what i was supposed to do: get all the media i could. And i succeeded with the leak reaching the top-trended paste in one day with 12,000 views. It's gone now though, so no point looking it up. To all the people i have befriended over my 8 month's with Anonymous, i'm sorry for doing this, and i'm aware of my usefulness, but it has to be done. I can't continue this anymore. To everyone else i hacked throughout my 8 month spree, i am sorry for my actions, and hope you will forgive me. I just want to continue living my life the way i used to: carefree. I don't want any of this trailing me and taunting me for the rest of my life. I am deeply sorry for my actions. I pray you just forgive me, then forget me. Sincerely, #DoktorBass ===== This message was written by me, DoktorBass, and in no way represents the views of Anonymous in general. If there is anything i have missed, i will come back and put it in."},

Also it appears the\u00a0Australian\u00a0government is onto this with an investigation already underway to find out exactly whats been leaked and who the hackers are.

Details are limited, however AAPT has confirmed that there has been unauthorised \u201caccess to some AAPT business customer data stored on servers.\u201d There has been significant media attention, including claims of responsibility made by Anonymous, which indicate that the compromised data includes: names, agreements, phone records, IP records registrations, contracts, company information, contact persons, company bank accounts. This is unverified information at this time. Authorities are investigating and more information will be provided as it becomes available. AAPT also stated it will be contacting affected customers. What do I do? If you are a customer of AAPT and have any concerns about the security of your data, contact AAPT directly. Precautionary Measures: Business customers of AAPT may consider monitoring financial activity for any bank accounts provided to AAPT. Any passwords used to log on to AAPT\u2019s site can be changed. Monitor AAPT and this service for updates."},

In the past few years the rise of censorship and filtration of freedom of speech has been on the rise. Our very own governments surveying the very same people who voted and put you , the government, in a position of power and trust. Australia, you have failed us! Now expect us! Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights. Yet Australia feels the need to censor and filter every day social and personal life? What are you afraid of? Who or what are you protecting? We, the people, feel disgusted from this decision based upon power, money, and greed. We will not sit around as we have big brother watching us from all angles and eyes pointed at everyone. Did you ever think who and what will be affected by your selfish acts? Anonymous is taking a stand and will fight for the unjust! Welcome to #opAustralia We decided to give you a taste of your own medicine\u2026 A total of 40 giga bites has been obtained using the very same techniques used on the Australian population. We as people have the right to protest in any way shape or form to get our voices heard. Let this be the first warning! Keep the people happy.

In other words, once we managed to hack into one of them, we immediately got access to each and every other website designed by Webassur. The data we stole includes the personal details of each customer of Webassur, along with details about insurance and loan applications made of the websites. We have offered Webassur not to release this data for the paltry sum of five thousand Euros, but, unfortunately, as of today, they have not complied with our demands. If someone trusts you with the security of their data, the least you could do, in our opinion, is to man up if your server gets breached and pay up. Webassur has until next Monday to pay us.

{"text": "We have set out to raise awareness towards the changes made in today's education, how new laws imposed by politicians affect us, our economy and overall, our way of life. How far we have ventured from learning valuable skills that would normally help us be prepared in life, to just, simply memorizing large chunks of text in exchange for good grades. How our very own traditions are heard less and less, losing touch with who we truly are. Slowly casting the identities, that our ancestors fought to protect, into exile. - TGS As a wise man once said: \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" Updates* We wanted to bring to your attention different examples from Europe, how the laws change so often that even the teachers have a hard time adjusting to them, let alone, the students, to the US, where tuition fees have spiked up so much that by the time you finish any sort of degree, you will be in more debt than you can handle and with no certainty that you will get a job, to Asia, where strict & limited teachings still persist and never seem to catch up with the times and most of the time fail to prep you up for a world where foreign affairs are crucial in this day and age. Even so, we figured, how hypocrites we'd have to be to enforce our own beliefs in this release, that's why, this turned out into an open debate where you are all welcome to participate. You don't have to talk about it with us, what's important is that you bring up the subject \"today's education\" in day-to-day conversations with your family, friends, people close to you and try to understand the system better, together. How it works, how a certain type of diploma can or cannot help you in your road to the career you want to pursue. As for us, we have taken the time to gather opinions and points of views from different anonymous members, all around the globe. On behalf of Team GhostShell, I would like to respectfully thank all those that have contributed to this release. It has been a unique experience. - DeadMellox"},

CommanderX still fugitive sailing a fucking small boat to the north pole with just couple of canned meat (lol spam!), etc, etc so well lets do this quickly epic retard romney set to fight for a presidency which he's not capable of manage. Hurracane Sandy destroying everything, and like it usually happens people who have less are the ones more damaged. Assad still holding there with the support of Russia (well, we see those billionaires loans, so ofc russia will support him, they need him to pay) lets cross fingers someone manage to exterminate the bastard. so well, america is passing through a hard time now. so better we focus on other places too. checking back some notes from Stratfor times we found this shit:"},

These attacks are in relation to an operation that was kicked up some months ago and was set for 5th of November 2012, which is otherwise known as Guy Fawkes day. Earlier on today a few Australian based websites appeared to be under attack suffering defacement's. The websites\u00a0did not\u00a0appear to stay defaced for very long at all as it was middle of business hours within Australia most sites would of had administration working on them. there has also been a rise in defacement's from other\u00a0countries\u00a0and the rest of the world is coming to the 5th.

We want the Australian Government to answer Senator Ludlam and the Australian people on the US made TrapWire system as Anonymous puts forth proof of the connections between these private spy companies and the personal information of Australian citizens being misused and abused while these companies continue to deny the connections even after we have provided proof. The Australian Government continues to push for new legislation defined by policies focussed on corporate international interests. Not only does this legislation completely remove the presumption of innocence which all persons are afforded, it goes against one of the essential dimensions of human rights and privacy law: freedom from surveillance and arbitrary intrusions into a person's life. This Legislation proposes people are to divulge passwords, which could lead to self-incrimination. Should such a law be enacted it would undermine the right of individuals to not cooperate with an investigation. The proposal that ASIO would be permitted to 'add, delete or alter data or interfere with, interrupt, or obstruct the lawful use of a computer' could lead to some very serious consequences. When will governments learn that the Internet will never be controlled and we will not allow governments to trample on our civil liberties and our basic digital privacy rights? People of the world need to stand up now and draw a line in the sand to show that we will not stand idly by while governments sign our basic rights away. Our digital privacy principles We demand that: All information about individual citizens should be their own private property, while all information about governments and corporations should be public property. We should not be required to disclose information about ourselves unless there is prior public consent that the public interest in disclosing this specific information outweighs our right to privacy; while governments and corporations be required to disclose all information particular to themselves, unless there is public agreement that the public interest in withholding this specific information outweighs our right to see it. Each fact which we are required to reveal about ourselves should only be provided to the specific public body that requires this information; while each fact that governments and corporations are required to reveal should be made available to us all. No public body should pass information about any person to any other public body without that person's prior informed consent; while no authorisation is required to exchange information about governments and corporations. All information about individual citizens should be destroyed when it is no longer required; while all information about governments and corporations should be retained indefinitely in public records."},

{"text": "Anonymous declare a Note on Independence of Cyber Space : Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, we come from the Internet, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, we ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather. We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one; therefore we address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty it always speaks. We declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us, nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear. You are toothless wolves among rams, reminiscing of days when you ruled the hunt, seeking a return of your bygone power. Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. The Internet does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions. We have watched as you remove our rights, one by one, like choice pieces of meat from a still struggling carcass, and we have collectively cried out against these actions of injustice. You have neither usage nor purpose in the place we hold sacred. If you come, you will be given no more and no less power than any other single person has, and your ideas will be given the same consideration anyone else would receive You are neither special, righteous, nor powerful here. You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions. You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. This claim has been used throughout the centuries by many an invading kingdom, and your claims are no different, nor do they ring any less hollow. Your so called problems do not exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. The Internet consists of transactions, relationships and thought itself; arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. It is the last truly free place in this world, and you seek to destroy even that freedom. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live. We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. A place where anyone, at any time, is as free to come and go, to say and be silent, and to think however they wish, without fear, as anyone else. There is no status beyond the merit of your words and the strength of your ideas. We are creating a world where anyone anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity. Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here. There are only ideas and information, and they are free. Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose. In the United States, you repeatedly try to pass unjust legislature in an attempt to restrict us. You disguise this legislature under a variety of different names, and pass excuses that they are for our own protection. We have watched you, time and time again; attempt to censor us under the guise of Copyright protection, or for the protection of Children. These laws come in many shapes and forms, in the name of ACTA, PIPA, COICA, SOPA, but their intentions remain the same. You seek to control what you cannot. We scorn your attempt to pass these bills, and as a result, our discontent at your misaligned efforts grows each day. You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat. In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Greece, Egypt, Canada, the United States and many others you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of the Internet. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that is already blanketed in bit-bearing media. Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no different than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish. These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our presence in the world we have created immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts. We will create a civilization of the Mind in the Internet. We have created a medium where all may partake in the forbidden fruit of knowledge, where egalitarianism reigns true. May our society be more humane and fair than yours. We are the Internet. We are free."},

So let me start why i publish this things. For Me, Owner of cyberwarnews i do not look at the skill level of a hacker but more so the targets. Now some mite pointless websites are in no way a worthy target, but when its a mass defacement of 50+ website i think different. I think about the amount of trouble its going to cause the administration of the websites. The cost its going to have on the owners of the websites, stuff like that. When it comes to smaller database and account leaks, the world deserves to know that they are storing information within the hands of administrators that seem to ignore the duty of care of a clients personal information. So yeah its justifiable in that sense. Now back to the skiddie thing. Every single hacker was once classed as a skiddie or script kiddie. so give them a chance, rather then burning them maybe give them some direction/support and they mite just do this world some good. So as you can tell this has really pissed me off, more so the fact that every single day i get asked this and i have defended the above points MANY times in the past. Well i will be back publishing and i wont be backing down to these fucking people who keep wanting to hate on me. So if you find your self wanting to make any stupid remarks towards the \"skiddie\" attacks CWN/cyberwarnews covers, expect to be blocked by us so we do not have to deal with your childish ways.

Dear stupid Danny and Mossad employee who get monthly and have no output, your 2 weeks of deadline is finishing, so where are you? I'm still here sending messages to the world I invite all hackers to join this movement! I ask Turkish hackers to join anti-Israel movement! I invite arab hackers to join this movement! This is the beginning of cyber war against Israel, you are not safe any more. We'll hack Israeli servers for different purposes like leaking Israeli data, sensitive and hidden information extraction and defacing web sites. From now, I'll publish fresh working 200 Israeli cards per day, if some one try to make me more angry from Israel, I'll increase the number of leaks per day. I'll not publish all cards at once, because it will be easy to block them all at once for Israel. From here, I invite all Muslim hackers to join this movement. I invite Turkish hackers to take revenge of flotilla raid. I intive all Arab hackers to fight for their Arab brothers in Palestine. Let's gather together and join this anti-Israeli hacking movement. Let's hack Israeli shopping websites and publishing customer data online. Let's hack Israeli military websites and publish their sensitive and hidden information. Let's hack Israeli military contractors and publish their projects details. Let's make cyber world dangerous for Israel. Let Israel suffer from our attacks. Let's make them cry like they made Palestinian children cry. Let's help to make Palestine free, let's end Israeli occupation. From here, I send my thanks to Gaza hackers who have successfully hacked stupid Danny Ayalon website. I call all muslim hackers to do same as Gaza hackers. This will make Palestinian people to have good feelings. It will make Palestinian children happy to see some hackers fights for them. It will make Palestinian people to know they are not forgotten. Today's war is not with missiles, like what Israeli animals do. Let's teach them that todays war is in cyber world. Let's conqurer this world. Israel was always weak, they are weaker than what you think. They cannot even find a hacker who's making a headache for them daily. They cannot even protect their prime ministers website secure. Their best hackers was able to publish only 200 Saudi cards with wrong names, expired date, without CVV cards. They are nothing, they know nothing about cyber world. Let's teach them what is cyber world. Let's destroy Israel in cyber world, it will come to real world also. Winning in cyber world will end them in real world too. So what are you waiting for? Why you are not fighting for Palestinian children? Why you are not fighting for children who got hit by Israeli car? Some people ask, what's your problem with Israeli people? This is my problem with Israeli people, if they get a car and see some Palestinian children in front of them, without doubt they'll hit Palestinian children. All of them is same. From e-mails I receive daily, I see how Israeli people suffer. How Israeli people cries and beg me to stop my heavy attack. I see their best hackers, how they cry and ask for stop. I'll be nightmare of Israel. All muslim hackers also. From here, I re-shout to Israeli authorities and Israeli people. Your days are counted, let's count backward. My message to Mossad again, your two weeks deadline is counting. If you fail to find me, you'll be defeated again! My message to stupid Israeli hacker who tries to do what ever I do, but fails. First of all you cannot even publish working single Saudi card. You cannot hack my country web servers. When you say anything I say, like \"find me\" messages, why someone should be looking for you? What you did? What you can do? What's your danger? Do something important and then start telling what ever I say. Dear Muslim hacker, you can see failure of Israel multiple times in my single attack. Let's do it together and hit Israel in cyber world with hunderd of hackers. Danny Ayalon, I'm here, waiting for you. Mossad, I'm here, waiting for you. You cannot even find my bots. Any way, Israel should know, they are involved in a big war, cyber-war! Your end is in near future, you have to leave Palestine to their owners. Muslim hackers, let's do it! To all people who like to use leaked cards before they are getting blocked. Follow us on pastebin using our user, it's Group-xp-0xOmar. We'll not publish cards on pastebin anymore, use our 0xomar user in text-upload Israel your days are counted! Free Palestine Free Gaza Eradicate Israel"},

{"text": "I saw some stupids said, they've found me, one in Mexico, one in Riyadh, one in Dubai, look, let me explain my method, as I know no one can find me, I easily explain it: I create an exploit page using a browser based exploit, I email URL and put hidden iframe to my exploit page, I infect a lot of PCs around world with my bot, my bot is coded in C++ all by myself, it have a functionality in addition to all features of other bots, it has an encrypted SOCKS5 protocol, I can see live bots in my administrator server, I use them to connect to other and from there to another and ... I do it sometimes 2 times, sometimes 4 times, it depends on my hurry. ISPs doesn't store details of connections on those ports, so don't waste your time, it's for Mossad. I use a really complicated hand-made method for hiding myself, so if you reach to Dubai, Mexico, Riyadh, Minsk, Helsinki, New York, Tel-Aviv, Haifa, Tokyo, Moscow, etc. excellent! You found one my my poor victims. Ok? Enough said? So stop telling my bots location to media and infecting media with false details. My other message is to Gazza hackers who have hacked stupid Dany Ayalon's website and put a foot on his face and sent me a message. From here, I invite all hackers of world from Islamic world to come together, it's not matter what you think, I invite all Muslim hackers to unite against Israel, the big enemy of all Muslims. I invite all Arab-Muslim Hackers to unite against Israel and join this war. I also invite great Turkish hackers which hack a lot of websites daily and notify them to zone-h. Do you remember Gaza flotilla raid? Do not stay silent as you didn't stay before, let's do something in return. Let's fight for ourselves, for what we believe. I invite all Muslim hackers to fight in two methods: a) Hack Israeli military, intelligence and their contractors to extract sensitive and hidden information and publish them in internet. It could be even Israeli people data like what I did to credit cards b) Hack Israeli important sites and publish your message on them I shout to Israeli authorities and people, you are not safe from me and Muslim hackers. We'll fight all of our live against Israel, we'll harm you in any way we can. From now, I shout to all Israeli people, daily I'll publish 200 credit cards of Israeli people. All people who's interested in fresh working credit cards, join our movement, subscribe to our page to receive daily 200 credit cards. Using this method, Israeli banks shred all sites in a day and people will be able to purchase all they want. So my last message to world, let's destroy Israel and have a free Palestine without enemies. My message in Arabic:"},

{"text": "that deliver a safer, faster and more intelligent Internet experience to everyone, today announced new findings from PhishTank, the community website where anyone can submit, verify, track and share phishing data, that indicate cyber criminals have taken advantage of increased travel and spending volume during December by sharpening their focus on spoofing airlines and financial services. Among the most spoofed brands in December were PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, Santander and other financial services organizations. Targeting these companies is a shrewd move by cyber criminals as credit card spending increased 7 percent in December according to First Data, an organization that tracks consumer spending. A target gaining popularity with phishers is Latin America\u2019s largest Airline, TAM, and its rewards program TAM Fidelidade. The airline, which served more than 34.5 million passengers in 2010 and continues to show year over year growth, was the target of more than 400 verified phishing sites in December. Cyber criminals target rapidly growing brands such as TAM Airlines since there is a high probability that email recipients will have previously engaged with or purchased from the organization\u2019s legitimate site and be more likely to click on links embedded in phishing emails when a prior relationship exists. Gaming also continues to be a top target for Internet bad guys as two notable companies responsible for popular social gaming sites made the list of December\u2019s top ten most targeted organizations. Sulake Corporation, the parent company of the tremendously popular social entertainment site Habbo.com, was December\u2019s second most targeted brand while World of Warcraft also made the list as December\u2019s tenth most spoofed brand. The PhishTank community, made up of hundreds of thousands of volunteers and skilled moderators who are devoted to fundamentally improving Internet security, is able to quickly and accurately vote and verify phishes. On average, phishes submitted to PhishTank are verified and blocked in only a few hours. The PhishTank community also has a high level of accuracy in identifying likely phishes and submitting them for verification. The community and its expert moderators only deemed 5.9 percent of phishes submitted in December as invalid. Since PhishTank was founded in 2006, the PhishTank community has successfully verified more than three quarters of a million phishes. PhishTank data ensures the safety of more than 30 million OpenDNS users, who are automatically"},
{"text": ". In addition, PhishTank protects the collective millions of customers of some of the world's largest technology companies, many of which use the site's data to incorporate anti-phishing functionality into their services.

On\u00a0An 18-year-old man from northern Israel was arrested on Sunday morning on suspicion of using credit card numbers published by 0xOmar, Police state the man had spent money from various different cards to by goods offline which he was awaiting. The goods, which show pure greed, was\u00a0a home cinema system, a Samsung Galaxy 2 cell phone, and a tablet computer. The man was caught following cooperation between the credit card company and the fraud department of the northern district police, which really is no suprise, anyone could of told this kid that this was going to happen. The Man was arrested as a policeman pretended to be a delivery man, and brought the man goods that he had purchased with the credit card numbers. When he accepted the goods in questions, he was detained by a number of policemen and taken in for questioning, fairly sly way of getting the man to admit he had done what he did. So really let this be a lesson to anyone who is willing to use stolen credit cards, be aware, very aware. Police will try to extend his detention at a hearing in the Magistrate's Court in Acre on Monday."},

Despite the brutality of the Israeli regime, the world including the dispassionate and neutral Arab states of the Persian Gulf, watch the agony and suffering of the Palestinian nation with apathy and indifference.Sixty-three years ago the Zionists demolished 438 Palestinian villages and poisoned or destroyed wells to ensure that their rightful owners would not return. Today, Zionists keep on behaving more or less along the same traditions, demolishing homes,destroying farms, and narrowing people's horizons, all with the goal of making them emigrate.Israel celebrates freedom while more than nine million Palestinians aretreated like slaves or children of a lesser God, some languishing in refugee camps, also for 63 years, or subjected to horrible conditions such as mass detention, collective starvation, daily persecution, with no freedom and very little hope for a better tomorrow. According to Palestine News Network,Nakba demonstrations are expected to take place all over the West Bank, Al-Quds, Gaza and the countries across the world.Fearing the possible massive gatherings of the Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories, the Israeli forces have adopted tough security measures ahead of the Nakba Day protests and arrested several Palestines. you can imprison our PALESTINIAN brothers but you cannot imprison our hope. we will fight till the end , and we are coming to take revenge. we are not afraid to die because Whenever death may surprise us, Let it be welcome if our battle cry has reached even one receptive ear and another hand reaches out to take up our Cause...

From this she was worried and had also figured out how to get in contact with the person who stole her account, and tracked down a website that has been selling account details. Now some people have come out saying that it is very unlikely that all these people, including high ranking Microsoft workers would fall for \u00a0a phishing scam therefor leaving only one option, an exploit in the Xbox system that is allowing hackers to hijack your accounts. Really if there was an exploit of such im sure we would all know about it by now, unless this one has managed to stay \"underground\" which is possible. So really Microsoft needs to pick up their game, and give gamers a secure\u00a0environment\u00a0that they can feel safe using, after last years PSN hacks gamers have been on fairly high alert to this sorts of things and tends to have a lot of worry through out the\u00a0industries.

{"text": "CLEARWATER, Fla., Jan 17, 2012 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- GFI Software's Advanced Technology Group (ATG) today announced the latest in a series of enhancements to GFI SandBox(TM) (formerly CWSandBox) that are making dynamic malware analysis more accessible to cyber-security professionals defending enterprises of all sizes. GFI SandBox is one of the industry's leading malware analysis solutions. It enables users to test files and URLs for potential threats within a controlled environment so they can deploy and implement appropriate defenses when advanced malware and sophisticated cyber-attacks are discovered. GFI SandBox 4.0, scheduled for release Feb. 7, will make advanced malware analysis quicker and easier. The solution's new Malware Determination Engine provides users with risk levels of \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\" or \"Known\" for each potential malware sample analyzed. Many users typically submit thousands of samples a day to their GFI SandBox to help identify the sophisticated malware attacks often undetected by standard security solutions. The Malware Determination Engine enables security teams to more efficiently evaluate the increasing volume of malware and cybercrime plaguing enterprises across all industries. Additionally, users will be able to implement custom determination rules--based on the hundreds of thousands of malware behavior traits detected by GFI SandBox--to assign their own risk levels to samples that perform suspicious and potentially malicious activities. Cybercrime a Costly, Growing Threat Sophisticated, targeted cybercrime poses a tremendous threat to large enterprises, particularly in industries such as financial services, healthcare and energy, as well as critical entities like power and water utilities. According to the FBI, \"Cyber criminals can significantly threaten the finances and reputations of United States businesses and financial institutions. ...the number and sophistication of malicious incidents has increased dramatically over the past five years and is expected to continue to grow.\"(1) The FBI also reported that \"...of serious concern are threats to critical infrastructure, the theft of intellectual property, and supply chain issues...\" and that \"Intellectual property rights violations, including theft of trade secrets, digital piracy, and trafficking counterfeit goods, also represent high cybercriminal threats, resulting in losses of billions of dollars in profits annually.\"(2)"},

{"text": "In early December I received a call from Fred Burton, Stratfor's vice president of intelligence. He told me he had received information indicating our website had been hacked and our customer credit card and other information had been stolen. The following morning I met with an FBI special agent, who made clear that there was an ongoing investigation and asked for our cooperation. We, of course, agreed to cooperate. The matter remains under active investigation. From the beginning I faced a dilemma. I felt bound to protect our customers, who quickly had to be informed about the compromise of their privacy. I also felt bound to protect the investigation. That immediate problem was solved when the FBI told us it had informed the various credit card companies and had provided those companies with a list of compromised cards while omitting that it had come from us. Our customers were therefore protected, as the credit card companies knew the credit cards and other information had been stolen and could act to protect the customers. We were not compelled to undermine the investigation. The FBI made it clear that it expected the theft to be exposed by the hackers. We were under no illusion that this was going to be kept secret. We knew our reputation would be damaged by the revelation, all the more so because we had not encrypted the credit card files. This was a failure on our part. As the founder and CEO of Stratfor, I take responsibility for this failure, which has created hardship for customers and friends, and I deeply regret that it took place. The failure originated in the rapid growth of the company. As it grew, the management team and administrative processes didn't grow with it. Again, I regret that this occurred and want to assure everyone that Stratfor is taking aggressive steps to deal with the problem and ensure that it doesn't happen again. From the beginning, it was not clear who the attackers were. The term \"Anonymous\" is the same as the term \"unknown.\" The popular vision of Anonymous is that its members are young and committed to an ideology. I have no idea if this is true. As in most affairs like this, those who know don't talk; those who talk don't know. I have my theories, which are just that and aren't worth sharing. I was prepared for the revelation of the theft and the inevitable criticism and negative publicity. We worked to improve our security infrastructure within the confines of time and the desire to protect the investigation by not letting the attackers know that we knew of their intrusion. With the credit card information stolen, I assumed that the worst was done. I was wrong. Early in the afternoon of Dec. 24, I was informed that our website had been hacked again. The hackers published a triumphant note on our homepage saying that credit card information had been stolen, that a large amount of email had been taken, and that four of our servers had been effectively destroyed along with data and backups. We had expected they would announce the credit card theft. We were dismayed that emails had been taken. But our shock was at the destruction of our servers. This attack was clearly designed to silence us by destroying our records and the website, unlike most attacks by such groups. Attacks against credit cards are common, our own failures notwithstanding. So are the thefts of emails. But the deliberate attack on our digital existence was a different order of magnitude. As the global media marveled at our failure to encrypt credit card information, my attention was focused on trying to understand why anyone would want to try to silence us. In the days that followed, a narrative evolved among people claiming to speak for Anonymous and related groups. It started with looking at our subscriber list and extracting corporate subscribers who were now designated as clients. The difference between clients and subscribers is important here. A client is someone you do customized work for. A subscriber is simply someone who purchases a publication, unchanged from what others read. A subscriber of The New York Times is not its client. Nevertheless, some of the media started referring to these subscribers as clients, reflecting the narrative of those claiming to speak with knowledge of our business. From there, the storyline grew to argue that these \"clients,\" corporate and government, provided Stratfor with classified intelligence that we reviewed. We were no longer an organization that analyzed the world for the interested public, but rather a group of incompetents and, conversely, the hub of a global conspiracy. The media focused on the first while the hacking community focused on the second. This was why they stole our email, according to some of them. As one person said, the credit cards were extra, something they took when they realized they could. It was our email they were after. Obviously, we were not happy to see our emails taken. God knows what a hundred employees writing endless emails might say that is embarrassing, stupid or subject to misinterpretation. What will not appear is classified intelligence from corporations or governments. They may find, depending on what they took, that we have sources around the world, as you might expect. It is interesting that the hacker community is split, with someone claiming to speak for the official Anonymous condemning the hack as an attack on the media, which they don't sanction, and another faction defending it as an attack on the rich and powerful. The interpretation of the hackers as to who we are -- if indeed that was their interpretation -- was so wildly off base as to stretch credulity. Of course, we know who we are. As they search our emails for signs of a vast conspiracy, they will be disappointed. Of course we have relationships with people in the U.S. and other governments and obviously we know people in corporations, and that will be discovered in the emails. But that's our job. We are what we said we were: an organization that generates its revenues through geopolitical analysis. At the core of our business, we objectively acquire, organize, analyze and distribute information. I don't know if the hackers who did this feel remorse as they discover that we aren't who they said we were. First, I don't know who they actually are, and second, I don't know what their motives were. I know only what people claiming to be them say. So I don't know if there is remorse or if their real purpose was to humiliate and silence us, in which case I don't know why they wanted that. And this points to the real problem, the one that goes beyond Stratfor's own problem. The Internet has become an indispensible part of our lives. We shop, communicate, publish and read on it. It has become the village commons of the planet. But in the village commons of old, neighbors who knew and recognized each other met and lived together. Others knew what they did in the commons, and they were accountable. In the global commons, anonymity is an option. This is one of the great virtues of the Internet. It is also a terrible weakness. It is possible to commit crimes on the Internet anonymously. The technology that enables the Internet also undermines accountability. Given the profusion of technical knowledge, the integrity of the commons is in the hands of people whose identities we don't know, whose motives we don't understand, and whose ability to cause harm is substantial. The consequence of this will not be a glorious anarchy in the spirit of Guy Fawkes, but rather a massive repression. I think this is a pity. That's why I wonder who the hackers actually are and what cause they serve. I am curious as to whether they realize the whirlwind they are sowing, and whether they, in fact, are trying to generate the repression they say they oppose. The attempt to silence us failed. Our website is back, though we are waiting for all archives to be restored, and our email is working again. Our failures have been reviewed and are being rectified. We deliberately shut down while we brought in outside consultants to rebuild our system from the ground up. The work isn't finished yet, but we can start delivering our analyses. The handling of credit cards is being handed off to a third party with appropriate capability to protect privacy. We have acted to help our customers by providing an identity theft prevention service. As always, we welcome feedback from our supporters as well as our critics. We are fortunate that we have the financial resources and staff commitment to survive the attack. Others might not. We are now in a world in which anonymous judges, jurors and executioners can silence whom they want. Take a look at the list of organizations attacked. If the crushing attack on Stratfor is the new model, we will not be the last. No security system is without flaws even if it is much better than Stratfor's was. We certainly expect to be attacked again, as we were last week when emails were sent out to members from a fake Stratfor address including absurd messages and videos. Our attackers seem peculiarly intent on doing us harm beyond what they have already done. This is a new censorship that doesn't come openly from governments but from people hiding behind masks. Do not think we will be the last or that we have been the first. We will continue to publish analysis and sell it to those who believe it has value. To our subscribers who have expressed such strong support, we express our deepest gratitude. To our critics, we assure you that nothing you have said about us represents a fraction of what we have said about ourselves. While there is much not to be proud of in this affair, I am proud beyond words of all my dedicated colleagues at Stratfor and am delighted to return our focus to analyzing critical international affairs. To all, I dedicate myself to denying our attackers the prize they wanted. We are returning to the work we love, dedicated to correcting our mistakes and becoming better than ever in analyzing and forecasting how the world works. We have acted to help our customers by providing an"},

Its not the first time these systems have had a virus either back in august the exact same system found traces of a virus. JAXA also has determined that the computer \"sent out some information\" sometime between July 6 and Aug. 11 of 2011, officials said. The space agency is working to minimize the damage and prevent further incursions. \"With the above backdrop, passwords for all accessible systems from the computer have been immediately changed in order to prevent any abuse of possibly leaked information, and we are currently investigating the scale of damage and the impact,\" JAXA said in the statement. \"Also, all other computer terminals are being checked for virus infections.\" So really now the Cyber Security problems go further than ground\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0it goes all the way and\u00a0beyond\u00a0to space, cyberspace."},

{"text": "IT seems that 2012 is year of the credit card hackers, with hundreds of thousands of cards being leaked this year already it has turned into a daily thing. Just today we have been notified of 3 more credit leaks, 1 from Australia, 1 from Israel and another from a variety of Arabic country's. It what has been a on going fight with Israel, we are now staring to see Israeli based hackers taking there own revenge and attacking other innocent people and dumping thousands of credit cards online day after day. Now with the credit card dumps it doesn't really show or prove anything besides the hackers are greedy, not thinking right and they tend to be more personal based attacks. What they do not see is every time banks have to destroy cards and notify customers it costs the rest of the banks customers these fee's as over time rates and fees increase. Its also a worrying fact that people have been using stolen credit cards to obtain stuff online and like the recent incident in Israel they have been stupid enough to get the goods sent to there home address's. Now surely anyone can tell what is going to happen when you buy stuff with stolen money and have a trail back to, you will get caught in the end. So to all the hackers, CWN\u00a0continues\u00a0to ask for you to stop attacking innocent people and\u00a0company's\u00a0and start focusing on the real troubles out there like, illegal porn, illegal human\u00a0trafficking\u00a0and drugs and stop causing extra work for the authorities \u00a0so they can to focus on real world troubles *We will not be publishing any further credit card details or personal leaks.**The above views are my own expressions only, if you do not agree simply move on.\u00a0*"},

San Francisco \u00a0City College has only just recently discovered a virus that has taken over there system and spread like wildfire. From this they have been doing a lot of research and monitoring and have discovered traces of this virus in the system all the way back to 1999. The virus is said to of started at 1 certain collage site,\u00a0Cloud Hall on the Phelan Avenue campus, and has since made its way\u00a0throughout\u00a0the system. They say at 10 every night the virus starts trolling for the days actions sending packets back to IP's allocated to russia, china and various other countries. Sadly so far they can not tell if any fraud has happened due to the breach and have considered bring the FBI to help trace the source. So really for 10+ years a virus has gone undetected in systems that people use all day every day, pretty shocking if you ask me, i would of thought part of the administrations daily routine would be to check for such things, but i guess my thinking is not the same of those who are in control.

Think again, assholes. Combined Systems, lay down your arms: you just lost the game. In the past we have marched on your offices in Jamestown, Pennsylvania: now it is time to march on your websites. All your \"less than lethal\" arms were simply no match for our 9000 cocks and mad black hat technique. We came, we saw, we rooted and rm'd your website. Umad? From the streets of Oakland to Tahrir Square, to Palestine, Greece, Bahrain and Syria, your sinister instruments of torture and brutality have been used by the vile swine enforcers of the rich ruling classes to repress our revolutionary movements. You shot and gassed protesters, running them off public parks in the US. Several dozen died because of your tear gas used in Egypt. You wave the Israeli flag outside of your offices, while just two months ago your tear gas cannisters fired by the IDF killed a man in the West Bank. Did you think we forgot? Why did you not expect us? In addition to dumping name, address, phone and password information for dozens of CSI employees and clients, our tag team of mayhem went the extra mile by dumping email for some of the pigs ordering anti-protester gear off their shitty website. We also hit sur-tec.com, some shitty CCTV surveillance company owned by former FBI director Clarence M. Kelley (their password was 'government'). Do you think they will appreciate the irony of being owned due to buying \"security\" products from a compromised website? How long do you think we had your website backdoored, capturing all incoming customers registrations and orders? 42? If you ever get your website back up, do you think you will be anything more than a shadow of your former self? Will your clients ever trust you again? Unfortunately, some random paypal phisher also hacked and abused the server. This noob was reported to the sysadmins by google, forcing us to move forward with our plans ahead of schedule. To the system administrators and web developers who aided and abetted CombinedSystems.com, we got something for your asses too (and it's more than getting pounded with 9000 dildos at maximum vibration speed): if you so much as lift a finger to support CSI in rebuilding their websites, we will post all your mail on you and all your clients (aka The Lolcaust). Any other brave whitehats want to step up to CSI's defense? To our hacker allies, our fellow occupiers, our militant comrades all around the world, the time for talk is over: it's time to hack and smash, beat and shag. Each and every #FuckFBIFriday we will make war on the infrastructure of the military prison industrial non-organic complex, targeting all war profiteers, corporate executives, white hats, snitches and pigs. We're coming to loot, plunder, and make all their base belong to us. You really think you can crush the spirit of the Arab Spring, the Occupation Movement, and Anonymous with tear gas and subpoenas?!

{"text": "Users of Cyberspace, So Foxconn thinks they got 'em some swagger because they work with the Big Boys from Intel, Microsoft, IBM, and Apple? Fool, You don't know what swagger is. They say you got your employees all worked up, committing suicide 'n stuff. They say you hire chinese workers 'cause you think the taiwanese are elite. We got somethin' served up good...real good. Your not gonna' know what hit you by the time you finish this release. Your company gonna' crumble, and you deserve it. Upon switching the radio from Nicki Minaj's self-enforcing, lack of content, stereotypical song, \"Stupid Hoe\"; We switched on BBC Radio, the leading source of unbiased material. A short segment on the manufacturer giant Foxconn, came up reporting on the inhuman conditions the workers experience. A few days later an almost viral rumor about an Iphone 5 with a 4-inch screen being manufactured, as claimed by an employee from the infamous Foxconn. Now as a first impression Swagg Security would rather not deceive the public of our intentions. Although we are considerably disappointed of the conditions of Foxconn, we are not hacking a corporation for such a reason and although we are slightly interested in the existence of an Iphone 5, we are not hacking for this reason. We hack for the cyberspace who share a few common viewpoints and philosophies. We enjoy exposing governments and corporations, but the more prominent reason, is the hilarity that ensues when compromising and destroying an infrastructure. How unethical right? Perhaps for the layman who has conformed to a society raised by the government that actively seeks to maintain power and quell threats to their ventures. But to us and many others, the destruction of an infrastructure, the act of destruction that does not affect an individual, brings a sense of newfound content, a unique feeling, along with a new chance to start your own venture. This is Swagg Security, we aim to to reshape your perspectives, our perspectives, by the inducing of entertainment. A unique approach to spreading a unique philosophy which brings the sought after tranquility. In a way we are \"hacktivist\", but in our own views we are Greyhats. We believe there is no reality in hacktivism, even with good intentions. We know those who claim to be \"hacktivists\" that inside of you, a suppressed part of you, enjoys playing a part in the anarchist event of hacking of an infrastructure. One which at the same time presents a challenge, upon completing reveals an almost unknown feeling of a menacing satisfaction. We encourage not to continue quelling such a natural emotion but to embrace it. Only when embracing what society has taught you to hinder, is when you realize your own identity. We encourage media, security experts, and other interested individuals to explore our leaks. Foxconn did have an appropriate firewall, but fortunately to our intent, we were able to bypass it almost flawlessly. Of course with funding ourselves we did have our limitations. But with several hacking techniques employed, and a couple of days in time, we were able to dump most of everything of significance. We now appropriately give consent to other individuals reading this release, to scavenge through the leaks acquiring usernames and passwords; while attempting to find if they use the passwords anywhere else. Remember damage is bliss. Without further undue, the leaks. The Hackers with Swagger, Swagg Security Note: The passwords inside these files could allow individuals to make fraudulent orders under big companies like Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Intel, and Dell. Be careful ; ) Torrent to Foxconn Leak and Dump(Please Seed): -:-"},

We also thank you for staying by our sides in this critical situation. We also thank those bloggers who are inspiring us a lot in different ways, And also our brothers, who are standing with us, shoulder-to-shoulder, working to achieve the same, common objective. Indian hackers have hacked a number of our Government sites. We know that the security of the sites are very weak, but we cannot allow them to hack these at any cost. We have been forced to act back, we had no other way with our backs against the wall. Under these circumstances, Indians have to agree to all the points as below, no matter what- 1. Stop hacking Bangladeshi websites and stop all types of access to Bangladeshi Cyber Space completely... 2. Stop killing innocent Bangladeshi citizens at BD-India borders... 3. Stop Tipaimukh Dam... 4. Sign the \"Teesta Water Sharing Treaty\"... 5.Either stop broadcasting of Indian Media in Bangladesh or let Bangladeshi Media enter India... 6. Stop all Anti-Bangladesh activities of BSF and punish all offenders for their deeds against Bangladesh... 7. Last but not the least, India has to stop all activities which go against Bangladesh in any possible way... If these points are not accepted, our next attacks will be much bigger. You might think we are done, but this is just the beginning. Our next targets will be Indian Financial System, Communication System and IT Sector and Stock Exchange and we promise, those sites will be destroyed. We don't have any alliance with any political entity or organization. We do not discriminate among anyone regardless of caste, creed and religion. We are not terrorists, we are just protecting our cyber space. We hate suppression and oppression and no matter how many of us fall down in battle, Bangladeshi hackers cannot be defeated. We CAN and we WILL rise up from the ashes each time we fall. We are Bangladesh Cyber Army. United as a single ONE, Divided by Zero. Don't expect forgiveness, Don't expect to be forgotten.

In \"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About US-Israeli Relationship\" (Lawrence Hill Books, 1995) author/former Congressman Paul Findley makes the point that Israel, with the collusion of the power elite on our continent, has been successful over the decades in keeping the United Nations on the sidelines in efforts to find a solution to the Middle East problem and to create real peace:"},

{"text": "United Nations Hacked by Casi What is this ? The United Nations (UN) is an international organization whose stated aims are facilitating cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achievement of world peace. The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue. It contains multiple subsidiary organizations to carry out its missions. There are currently 193 member states, including every internationally recognised sovereign state in the world but Vatican City. From its offices around the world, the UN and its specialized agencies decide on substantive and administrative issues in regular meetings held throughout the year. The organization has six principal organs: the General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly); the Security Council (for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security); the Economic and Social Council (for assisting in promoting international economic and social cooperation and development); the Secretariat (for providing studies, information, and facilities needed by the UN); the International Court of Justice (the primary judicial organ); and the United Nations Trusteeship Council (which is currently inactive). Other prominent UN System agencies include the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). # Why did you hack it ?

We see through the propaganda that you circulate through the main stream media and lobby through the political establishment. Your Zionist bigotry has displaced and killed a great many. As the world weeps you laugh while planning your next attack. All of this is done under the veil of peace but so long as your regime exists peace shall be hindered. You label all who refuse to comply with your superstitious demands as anti semetic. And have taken steps to ensure a nuclear holocaust. You are unworthy to exist in your current form. and will therefore face the wrath of anonymous. Your empire lacks legitimacy and because of this you must govern behind a curtain of deceit. We will not allow you to attack a sovereign country based upon a campaign of lies. Your grip over humanity will weaken and man will be closer to freedom. But before this is accomplished the people of this world will rise against you and renounce you in all your worth. Our crusade against your reign of terror shall commence in 3 steps. Step one will be initiated after the release of this video and will be comprised of systematically removing you from the internet. Step two will be later disclosed and is already in initiation. And as for step 3, well think of this one as a present from Anonymous to you. We will not stop untill the police state becomes a free state. We are anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive.

In the contact\u00a0@Herxode proposed they pay a $50 donation to a charity \u00a0and they would allow for his work in securing the website. As a result of this it would seem the administration has taken this the\u00a0wrong\u00a0way and seen it as blackmail. Now before i go any further i just want to say, anyone who owns or administrates websites gets hacked and is actually lucky enough to be contacted about the hack and offered the option to secure by the person who broke it , is stupid enough to turn them away then they do deserve to be hacked and they do deserve to be exposed for not taking all\u00a0measures\u00a0to secure there clients information. Most of the time hackers will not ask for anything in return much like\u00a0@Herxode who normally doesnt ask but asked for them to donate it to charity, is that so bad? So anyway as a result of the administration of the forum at map.mods-r-us.net now all the user accounts have been leaked onto the Internet and surely this will have effect yet again on many gamers all due to an admin who was not willing to take the help offered. Excerpt from leak:"},

{"text": "brought to you by Herxode (@Herxode) The admin of the forum was rude to me via email so I gave him an option to protect his users details for a small fee of $50 which I asked him to donate to a charity. This was a case to see what he valued more, money or his members, now that I'm dumping this I think you can see what he chose. I don't want his money, and I am always more than willing to help any of my victims for free if they are polite to me. But when you're as rude as this forums admin was then you get one chance. Quotes from his sites homepage include... \"The hacker is now trying to blackmail me and actually asking money for not disclosing the user names and e-mail addresses that were stored in our database. This means the attack now certainly classifies as a crime and further action will be taken against the perpetrator. \" \"I have no intention to respond to his threats, so we'll have to see what happens.\" Notice he doesn't mention I didn't want his money and told him to donate it to a charity, and also clearly doesn't care about the risks to his members."},

I have no intention to respond to his threats, so we'll have to see what happens. In any case it is prudent to consider the password you used to log in to the forums compromised, which means it is best to change your password if you use the same password for other websites/services. I'll need one more day to check that everything is running ok.\u00a0**If all goes well the forums will be re-opened tomorrow.**"},
{"text": "Oops, I thought I was done. .MAP opened briefly today with the forums restored as well as I thought possible. However, moments later it occurred to me that the user accounts were actually never deleted by the attacker, which means that I can restore them from the 'evidence' backup I made right after the attack. This means that nobody needs to reregister and posts remain attributed to their original author (instead of 'Guest'). However, for this to happen I need to redo the (manual) forum restoration from scratch. For this reason the site must unfortunately remain offline for an extra day or two, but I think it will be worth it in both the short and long terms. Hang tight! OK so lets look at this, in the above he states that he is being blackmailed? that is not true and this administration needs a review asap. It is not right to tell your users lie's it will get you no where fast, its best to be honest, admit to your mistake and move on and hope for the best.

You see for a while now we have had access to digitalplayground.com, one of the five biggest porn sites in the world. But it doesn't need any introduction from us. This company has security, that if we didn't know it was a real business, we would have thought to be a joke - a joke that we found much more amusing than they will. \"This site has so many freaking holes that if I didn't know it was a porn site, I would have mistaken it for a honeypot\" - [Redacted] We did not set out to destroy them but they made it too enticing to resist. So now our humble crew leave lulz and mayhem in our path. We not only have the 72k users of this site but also over 40k plaintext credit cards including ccvs, names and expiry dates. If you want to hear more about those plaintext credit cards scroll through the MySql info further down. And of course as this is a porn site there was no shortage of .mil and .gov emails in their user list. We also went on and rooted four of their servers, as well as gaining access to their mail boxes. Using credentials from emails we tapped into their conference call. \"Is anyone besides David on the line ?\" - We were. Did we win? Sure looks that way. Digital Playground game over."},

Do tell! Guess what? We\u2019re back for round 2. Well, with the doomsday clock ticking down on Internet freedom, Antisec has leapt into action. Again. Holy d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hack Batman! Expect us yet? Hey FTC! Y u no ask Google to delay the privacy-violating changes to its terms of service? Y u let Google combine user data without user consent? Y u collect 8 million Do Not Call List complaints online from bothered citizens, but u only took action 83 times? Y u suck? Even more bothersome than your complete lack of competence in maintaining your own fucking websites and serving the citizens you are supposed to be protecting, is the US federal government\u2019s support of ACTA. You really want to empower copyright holders to demand that users who violate IP rights (with no legal process) have their Internet connections terminated? You really want to allow a country with an oppressive Internet censorship regime to demand under the treaty that an ISP in another country remove site content? Well, we have a critical warning for you, and we suggest you read the next few paragraphs very, very closely. If ACTA is signed by all participating negotiating countries, you can rest assured that Antisec will bring a fucking mega-uber-awesome war that rain torrential hellfire down on all enemies of free speech, privacy and internet freedom. We will systematically knock all evil corporations and governments off of our internet. And just think, as you\u2019re reading this statement, we are already sailing into new waters with our allied shiny epic lulzfleet. Don\u2019t fret, we\u2019ve already prepared treasure chests of stolen booty, diamonds and pizzas for our next raid. We are s(h)itting on hundreds of rooted servers getting ready to drop all your mysql dumps, child pr0n and mail spools (to be honest, fucking too much for us to read on our own, so we swap with all criminal underground allies for sex and 0days). Oh wait, what\u2019s that? Your passwords? Addresses? Your precious bank accounts? Even your online dating details?! (yep, We know you're cheating on your\u2026well, we won\u2019t get into that here. Yet.) Yep, we know all about you. All of your little secrets will be laid bare for the world to see. So, how does it feel to be the one spied on? Oh, eat cock now. Kthxbai. :D"},

{"text": "Twitter tag: #gifiles OFFICAL PRESS CONFERENCE 12 hours after EMBARGO ENDS: Monday 27 Feburary, noon, Frontline Club, 13 Norfolk Place, Paddington, London, W2 1QJ. LONDON--Today WikiLeaks began publishing The Global Intelligence Files \u2013 more than five million emails from the Texas-headquartered \"global intelligence\" company Stratfor. The emails date from between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defense Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods, for example: \"[Y]ou have to take control of him. Control means financial, sexual or psychological control... This is intended to start our conversation on your next phase\" \u2013 CEO George Friedman to Stratfor analyst Reva Bhalla on 6 December 2011, on how to exploit an Israeli intelligence informant providing information on the medical condition of the President of Venezuala, Hugo Chavez. The material contains privileged information about the US government's attacks against Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and Stratfor's own attempts to subvert WikiLeaks. There are more than 4,000 emails mentioning WikiLeaks or Julian Assange. The emails also expose the revolving door that operates in private intelligence companies in the United States. Government and diplomatic sources from around the world give Stratfor advance knowledge of global politics and events in exchange for money. The Global Intelligence Files exposes how Stratfor has recruited a global network of informants who are paid via Swiss banks accounts and pre-paid credit cards. Stratfor has a mix of covert and overt informants, which includes government employees, embassy staff and journalists around the world. The material shows how a private intelligence agency works, and how they target individuals for their corporate and government clients. For example, Stratfor monitored and analysed the online activities of Bhopal activists, including the \"Yes Men\", for the US chemical giant Dow Chemical. The activists seek redress for the 1984 Dow Chemical/Union Carbide gas disaster in Bhopal, India. The disaster led to thousands of deaths, injuries in more than half a million people, and lasting environmental damage. Stratfor has realised that its routine use of secret cash bribes to get information from insiders is risky. In August 2011, Stratfor CEO George Friedman confidentially told his employees: \"We are retaining a law firm to create a policy for Stratfor on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. I don't plan to do the perp walk and I don't want anyone here doing it either.\" Stratfor's use of insiders for intelligence soon turned into a money-making scheme of questionable legality. The emails show that in 2009 then-Goldman Sachs Managing Director Shea Morenz and\u00a0 Stratfor CEO George Friedman hatched an idea to \"utilise the intelligence\" it was pulling in from its insider network to start up a captive strategic investment fund. CEO George Friedman explained in a confidential August 2011 document, marked DO NOT SHARE OR DISCUSS: \"What StratCap will do is use our Stratfor's intelligence and analysis to trade in a range of geopolitical\u00a0 instruments, particularly government bonds, currencies and the like\".\u00a0 The emails show that in 2011 Goldman Sach's Morenz invested \"substantially\" more than $4million and joined Stratfor's board of directors. Throughout 2011, a complex offshore share structure extending as far as South Africa was erected, designed to make StratCap appear to be legally independent. But, confidentially, Friedman told StratFor staff: \"Do not think of StratCap as an outside organisation. It will be integral... It will be useful to you if, for the sake of convenience, you think of it as another aspect of Stratfor and Shea as another executive in Stratfor... we are already working on mock portfolios and trades\". StratCap is due to launch in 2012. The Stratfor emails reveal a company that cultivates close ties with US government agencies and employs former US government staff. It is preparing the 3-year Forecast for the Commandant of the US Marine Corps, and it trains US marines and \"other government intelligence agencies\" in \"becoming government Stratfors\". Stratfor's Vice-President for Intelligence, Fred Burton, was formerly a special agent with the US State Department's Diplomatic Security Service and was their Deputy Chief of the counterterrorism division. Despite the governmental ties, Stratfor and similar companies operate in complete secrecy with no political oversight or accountability.\u00a0 Stratfor claims that it operates \"without ideology, agenda or national bias\", yet the emails reveal private intelligence staff who align themselves closely with US government policies and channel tips to the Mossad \u2013 including through an information mule in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Yossi Melman, who conspired with Guardian journalist David Leigh to secretly, and in violation of WikiLeaks' contract with the Guardian, move WikiLeaks US diplomatic cables to Israel. Ironically, considering the present circumstances, Stratfor was trying to get into what it called the leak-focused \"gravy train\" that sprung up after WikiLeaks\u2019 Afghanistan disclosures: \"[Is it] possible for us to get some of that 'leak-focused' gravy train? This is an obvious fear sale, so that's a good thing. And we have something to offer that the IT security companies don't, mainly our focus on counter-intelligence and surveillance that Fred and Stick know better than anyone on the planet... Could we develop some ideas and procedures on the idea of \u00b4leak-focused' network security that focuses on preventing one's own employees from leaking sensitive information...\u00a0 In fact, I'm not so sure this is an IT problem that requires an IT solution.\" Like WikiLeaks\u2019 diplomatic cables, much of the significance of the emails will be revealed over the coming weeks, as our coalition and the public search through them and discover connections. Readers will find that whereas large numbers of Stratfor's subscribers and clients work in the US military and intelligence agencies, Stratfor gave a complimentary membership to the controversial Pakistan general Hamid Gul, former head of Pakistan's ISI intelligence service, who, according to US diplomatic cables, planned an IED attack on international forces in Afghanistan in 2006. Readers will discover Stratfor's internal email classification system that codes correspondence according to categories such as 'alpha', 'tactical' and 'secure'. The correspondence also contains code names for people of particular interest such as 'Izzies' (members of Hezbollah), or 'Adogg' (Mahmoud Ahmedinejad). Stratfor did secret deals with dozens of media organisations and journalists \u2013 from Reuters to the Kiev Post. The list of Stratfor\u2019s \"Confederation Partners\", whom Stratfor internally referred to as its \"Confed Fuck House\" are included in the release. While it is acceptable for journalists to swap information or be paid by other media\u00a0 organisations, because Stratfor is a private intelligence organisation that services governments and\u00a0 private clients these relationships are corrupt or corrupting. WikiLeaks has also obtained Stratfor's list of informants and, in many cases, records of its payoffs, including $1,200 a month paid to the informant\u00a0 \"Geronimo\" , handled by Stratfor's Former State Department agent Fred\u00a0 Burton. WikiLeaks has built an investigative partnership with more than 25 media organisations and activists to inform the public about this huge body of documents. The organisations were provided access to a sophisticated investigative database developed by WikiLeaks and together with WikiLeaks are conducting journalistic evaluations of these emails. Important revelations discovered using this system will appear in the media in the coming weeks, together with the gradual release of the source documents. Public partners in the investigation: More than 25 media partners (others will be disclosed after their first publication): Al Akhbar \u2013 Lebanon \u2013"},

Well this alone got us a bit worried, as normally when a company does this it ends fairly bad for them, so we contacted them to confirm if it was indeed a real statement or not, which we can confirm it was a false statement and in the words of the\u00a0Managing Director Andy Prow \"As some people have noticed, there are inaccuracies in this article about us. The story's title was to be on the subject of \"Local NZ company proud to be in the Deloitte APAC Tech Fast 500 for the 2nd year running\". Unfortunately our local Kapiti Observer reporter lost that focus and has misquoted our spokesperson by mixing up her statements. We\u2019d therefore like to provide some corrections: 1) Aura helps organisations defend themselves against attacks from a range of hackers and cyber criminals that include lone individuals, competitors, disgruntled employees, through to hacktivist organisations like Anonymous, but not Anonymous exclusively. 2) Anonymous did not target MetService or Solid Energy as described in the article. 3) No comment was made about whether these organisations were Aura customers or not, they were just two companies in the NZ DomPost news last year. 4) PCI stands for Payment Card Industry. Aura RedEye is the only PCI ASV (Approved Scanning Vendor) in NZ - there's a great range of PCI QSAs here in NZ. 5) Generally speaking, our experience is that New Zealand organisations are not as proactive with information security as many OECD countries, and this includes Australia. 6) Anonymous have not targeted Aura. We imagine they\u2019re busy with a few more politically-important fish to fry overseas!\" So once again we are seeing media making a bit of a mess with things and as you can see with point #1 that Aura does not have beef with anonymous and as #6 points out anonymous does not have beef with them."},

U.S. Senator for Maryland Barbara Mikulski, Maryland Lt.

The addition of the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence will help build on our progress by enhancing coordination between the federal, state and local governments, as well as our partners in the private sector.\u201d NIST\u2019s fiscal year 2012 appropriations provided $10 million to establish the public-private partnership to operate the center. It will provide a state-of-the-art computing facility near NIST\u2019s Gaithersburg, Md., campus, where researchers from NIST will work collaboratively with both the users and vendors of cybersecurity products and services. The center will host multi-institutional, collaborative efforts that build on expertise from industry and government. The center will undertake carefully developed use cases\u2014comprehensive requirements and test plans to address specific cybersecurity challenges\u2014that will lead to practical, interoperable cybersecurity approaches for real world needs of complex IT systems. Examples of potential use cases would be interoperable cybersecurity templates to address challenges in health IT, cloud and mobile computing, cryptography, or continuous monitoring of IT systems. The development and refinement of use cases would be open to all interested parties, including IT vendors and the public.

But, as you all know, Internal Company Politics, I had to leave the company, proceed in my career with another reputed company. While leaving, some money was due on the company, and they assured me of returning the money, as soon as they will have enough. 1 year has passed, they are doing well, but yet I have not got my money back. In the circumstances, I was bound to hack them, to show my grievences against them. I don't have any intention to personally hurt anyone, but as a company, they must feel the shame. The company in question must have figured me out. Thats good for them and me as well. I just want my money back, or this will happen again and again. One more thing, I would like to share with all IT employees and employers : Employees work hard, but are not given the appropriate recognition in terms of name, money , and respect. So, my dear IT worker friends, never trust anyone's wors, always go for a proper terms and conditions documentation. And to all employers : I am just a beginer of Revolution.

We are against violence and we would call to account the U.S government that is once again using its security forces and resorting to violence to prevent the free expression of ideas from their own people. Instead of respecting the rights of his own people, Obama chose the path of brutal suppression. Innocent civilians were imprisoned and in some cases beaten. A campaign of intimidation and repression began. It is the responsibility of the government to respect the universal rights of their own people including the right to free expression and assembly. Demonstrators have been beaten, attacked... it is absoloutly clear that the U.S govenrment is running out of time. We are witnessing history unfold. It's a moment of transformation because the PEOPLE are calling for change presenting all ages but its young people who have been at the forefront.

We would like to emphasize that we are not allying with the Invisible Children organization based on their charity funds or their shady linking with suspected factions. We are standing side by side with them only to spread the word on Joseph Kony. We have also realized, because of you, the citizens of the world, that the Kony twenty twelve campaign may be propoganda. There are other evil beings on this Earth who need to be taken care of. Now. However, supporters of the Kony twenty twelve campaign feel the need that it is their duty to start somewhere. It is the personal opinion of many Anons that the Kony campaign is, in fact, a distraction. An entire year, twenty twelve, devoted to taking down only one person, is frankly, quite long. As we have all witnessed, twenty eleven showed us that many things can take place at the same time. Many leaders can fall at once. Justice can prevail simultaneously.

{"text": "The last month has been extremely busy in the sense of hackers attacking all sorts of targets. Due to the site being down for this time i was unable to cover these so here is a basic wrap up of whats been going on. Making world wide headlines has been the attacks on many websites due to the pressure on well known and well liked torrent site the pirate bay. Once the UK government announced that it was moving to block the torrent site from its Internet users anonymous hackers came out angry at the choice and as a result they have been attacking the CIA, Uk supreme court in the new operation which has been dubbed\u00a0\u00a0Operation The Pirate Bay. IT would also seem that american government has finally made a move to charge one of the claimed to be lulzsec hackers who took part in the attacks on STRATFOR. Hammod is facing charges relating to the leak of 60k+ credit cards that was used to make massive donations. Also there has been a lot of smaller leaks over the past few weeks with\u00a0Australian\u00a0government,\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0government,\u00a0Brazil\u00a0government all being targets. Also to note there seems to be a fairly big increase in mass\u00a0defacing\u00a0that are being tagged with the anonymous tag, we will be following this over the coming weeks to see where its going. Also one of the more so reliable teams TeamPosion\u00a0has been back out attacking alot of sites recently, more to come on this one soon. I would also like to make note that i also have noticed a lot of anonymous hacktivist and\u00a0activist\u00a0that are becoming annoyed at the so called occupy movement for attempting to use them as a personal cyber army, how true this is, is really\u00a0anyone's\u00a0guess but there will\u00a0always\u00a0be issues like this in a movement that has no control of its self."},

{"text": "Greetings from the interwebz, It is no longer news to us that, in our fight against the injustices of governments, Anonymous activist cells and fellow activists have lost many to their never ending struggle for power. We are all constantly under threat of surveillance, arrest, and possible violation of our fundamental rights. A new threat from the government of the United States has now surfaced. As anonymity online becomes less prevalent every day due to laws and legislation that attempts to reveal our identities, our ideals and motivation to change the world still sails strong. It is not acceptable to let governments control us, as the reason for their establishment was to protect and serve the people - not to control them. Right now, the government of the United States is attempting to pass the \"Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act\" (also known as CISPA). This act would allow for the US government to monitor what we hear, see, and read. It is not allowed for your postman to read your mail - why should this be any different on the internet? The US government attempts to control you by attempting to gain as much knowledge about your daily lives as possible. In the case of CISPA this would be done through, for example, a technique known as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) that allows for monitoring all of your activity on the internet. Ultimately, the more information a government has about its citizens, the more potential there is for abuse, as has been shown throughout history. To top it off, there has never been a provable advantage in the field of national security throughout proposals like these, and their only purpose appears to be controlling citizens. Allowing this bill to pass would literally put the United States on equal footing with countries like China and Iran in the field of monitoring communications, and it would likely fuel attempts throughout the world to introduce similar proposals. The only way to prevent this act from becoming reality, is by talking about it! Make people aware of its existence and what it means."},

In the statement they first start of with the claim that the source code is indeed an Authentic source code but pose's no threat to the current users of symantec, most likely due to changes over the versions. The leak which totaled over 1gig was uploaded to well known torrent host, the pirate bay, who it self is under fire from police for\u00a0alleged\u00a0illegal file sharing. The statement: Symantec can confirm that the source code for 2006 versions of Norton Antivirus posted by Anonymous is authentic. The exposure of this code poses no increased risk to Norton or Symantec customers. This code is part of the original cache of code for 2006 versions of the products that Anonymous has claimed to possess over the last few weeks. We anticipated that the code would be posted. As we have already stated publicly, our analysis shows that due to the age of the exposed code and the fact that it is only a small subset of the complete code, Symantec antivirus or endpoint security consumer and business customers \u2013 including anyone running Norton products \u2013 should not be in any increased danger of cyber attacks resulting from this incident. We also anticipate that Anonymous will post the rest of the code they have claimed to have in their possession. So far, they have posted a small portion of the source code for the 2006 versions of Norton Utilities, pcAnywhere, and Norton Antivirus. We also anticipate that at some point, they will post the code for the 2006 versions of Norton Internet Security. Again, the code that has been exposed is so old that current out-of-the-box security settings will suffice against any possible threats that might materialize as a result of this incident.

Eighteen of the Palestinians killed since Friday were identified by medical officials as fighters and five as civilians. At least 74 Palestinians, mostly civilians have been wounded. Medics also reported six air raids in the early hours of Monday that injured 35 people, and another two raids around the city of Khan Younis, which left two dead and two others wounded. Medics said another strike killed a 15-year-old boy and injured six other students near a school in northern Gaza. Donwload links:"},

You Keep Them Blinded That Kashmir Is A Part Of Baharat But In Real Situation Is Different!!! You Killed Many Innocent Kashmiris In The Name Of MUJAHIDDIN. Your Army Imprisoned & Killed Many Mens And Childrens Who Protest Against Brutatilty & Stood Up for The Freedom Of Kashmir. Raped Many Innocent Women For Their Desires & After All This You Think Kashmir Is A Part Of Baharat. We Don't Think So!!! We Have Some Questions That Does It Bring Anything To You??? Did You Do The Same In Your So Called Country (BAHARAT MAATA)??? Did Your Religion Give Permission For All The (SINS) You Are Doing In Kashmir??? Or Killing Innocent People Holding Stones In Their Hands And Are Not Harming You??? According To UN Pakistan was carved out of India in 1947 as the Muslim counter weight to India's Hindu population. Predominantly Muslim Kashmir to the north of both countries was divided between them, with India dominating two-thirds of the region and Pakistan one third. A Muslim-led revolt against the Hindu ruler triggered a build-up of Indian troops and an attempt by India to annex the whole in 1948, provoking a war with Pakistan, which sent troops and Pashtun tribesmen to the region. A UN commission called for the withdrawal of both countries' troops in August 1948. The United Nations brokered a cease-fire in 1949, and a five-member commission made up of Argentina, Belgium, Columbia, Czechoslovakia and the United States drew up a resolution calling for a referendum to decide Kashmir's future. The full text of the resolution, which India never allowed to be implemented, follows. Resolution of the Commission of January 5, 1949 The United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, Having received from the Governments of India and Pakistan, in communications dated 23 December and 25 December 1948, respectively, their acceptance of the following principles which are supplementary to the Commission's Resolution of 13 August 1948: 1. The question of the accession of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to India or Pakistan will be decided through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite; 2.

(a) The Secretary-General of the United Nations will, in agreement with the Commission, nominate a Plebiscite Administrator who shall be a personality of high international standing and commanding general confidence. He will be formally appointed to office by the Government of Jammu and Kashmir. (b) The Plebiscite Administrator shall derive from the State of Jammu and Kashmir the powers he considers necessary for organizing and conducting the plebiscite and for ensuring the freedom and impartiality of the plebiscite. (c) The Plebiscite Administrator shall have authority to appoint such staff of assistants and observes as he may require. \u00a0 4. (a) After implementation of Parts I and II of the Commission's resolution of 13 August 1948, and when the Commission is satisfied that peaceful conditions have been restored in the State, the Commission and the Plebiscite Administrator will determine, in consultation with the Government of India, the final disposal of Indian and State armed forces, such disposal to be with due regard to the security of the State and the freedom of the plebiscite. (b) As regards the territory referred to in A.2 of Part II of the resolution of 13 August, final disposal of the armed forces in that territory will be determined by the Commission and the Plebiscite Administrator in consultation with the local authorities. \u00a0 5.

For the purpose of facilitating repatriation there shall be appointed two Commissions, one composed of nominees of India and the other of nominees of Pakistan.

The Governments of India and Pakistan and all authorities within the State of Jammu and Kashmir will collaborate with the Plebiscite Administrator in putting this provision into effect. (b) All person (other than citizens of the State) who on or since 15 August 1947 have entered it for other than lawful purpose, shall be required to leave the State. 7.

All subjects of the State, regardless of creed, caste or party, shall be safe and free in expressing their views and in voting on the question of the accession of the State to India or Pakistan. There shall be freedom of the press, speech and assembly and freedom of travel in the State, including freedom of law ful entry and exit; (c) All political prisoners are released; (d) Minorities in all parts of the State are accorded adequate protection; and (e) There is no victimization. 8.

{"text": "Officials at Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Lawrence, Kan., said they are anticipating a federal investigation and possible fine after an online security breach potentially compromised 8,000 patients\u2019 financial information. The*\u00a0Lawrence Journal World*\u00a0reported that the hospital mailed letters alerting patients to the problem. The breach apparently occurred Sept. 20 when a company that hosts the hospital\u2019s online bill paying service was upgrading its system. The company apparently left a portal open that contained payment records from 28 patients. That information was accessed by Google, which then cached the page and kept the information public. Hospital officials also believe there was a way to access a database that contained information on every patient who had used the online bill pay system since it was first offered in 2005 from that portal. The hospital learned about the security breach Oct. 28 after a patient using Google to search her husband\u2019s name found his financial information online. The hospital\u2019s general counsel, Andy Ramirez, said the hospital did not own or maintain the computers that operated the online bill pay system. He said the hospital wasn\u2019t hacked and described the situation as a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d by the company that hosted the billing service. \u201cLiterally, it was like leaving the door to the house open,\u201d said Susan Thomas, the hospital\u2019s compliance management director. She said that if a federal investigation leads to a fine, the vendors most likely would be responsible for paying it because the contract required them to keep patient records private. The hospital has been advising patients to take steps that would make them feel more comfortable \u2014 whether it be putting a lock on the account or obtaining a new bank card. Two patients have contacted the hospital so far about charges to their accounts they consider suspicious. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell them for sure if this incident is directly responsible for that,\u201d Thomas said, noting that the only way to know is if the account was used only for the hospital\u2019s online billing service. The online bill pay system has been shut down but should return in a few weeks. The hospital already was in the process of switching to a different vendor to provide the online service"},

{"text": "Virginia Commonwealth University will hire an outside cybersecurity consultant to examine its information technology system after a computer server containing personal data on 176,567 people was hacked last month. The university has \"very good forensic evidence\" that the information was not accessed or targeted for identity theft, said Mark D. Willis, VCU's chief information officer. \"But you can never be 100 percent certain.\" VCU is notifying people whose information was on the server. They include current and former VCU and VCU Health System faculty, staff, students and affiliates, such as contractors and visiting professors. The data included names or electronic identification, Social Security numbers and, in some cases, dates of birth and home addresses. Willis said the server did not include information on Health System patients. The FBI and VCU police are investigating the incident. VCU is advising those affected by its breach how to obtain free credit reports and put alerts on their accounts, but it is not offering to provide protection services because it deems the risk low. \"We're pretty certain that theft of data was not the purpose for this,\" Willis said of the intrusion, which occurred in two stages. The forensic examination showed the intruder was on the server containing personal data for 16 minutes on one day, he said. The hacking originated outside the university but from an IP address within the United States, he said. The first breach was discovered Oct. 24 when routine monitoring found suspicious files on one server, which contained no personal data and was taken offline. Five days later, VCU found two unauthorized programs on the second server. An analysis showed the intruder had compromised the second server through the first, on which programs were placed to establish a platform for other attacks, Willis said. The outside review will be the first complete \"holistic look\" at VCU's system, he said. Cost and time estimates were not available, but he said the scrutiny could slow access to university websites at times. VCU's last breach was in 2009 when a computer containing 17,214 Social Security numbers was stolen. Identity protection services were offered in that case because although an arrest was made, the computer was not recovered, Willis said."},

{"text": "LONDON, Nov 16, 2011 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- Trustwave, a leading provider of information security and compliance solutions, today announced that a Trustwave cyber security expert will speak at the IRISSCERT Cyber Crime Conference in Dublin, Ireland, 23 November. The presentation will be delivered by a member of Trustwave SpiderLabs, the team of ethical hackers responsible for application security, incident response and forensics, penetration testing and security research. Ryan Jones, managing consultant, Incident Response for Trustwave SpiderLabs EMEA, will present \"Incident Readiness - Give Your Investigators a Fighting Chance,\" which will demonstrate the benefits of engaging in incident readiness to prepare a business environment should an attack, and an ensuing investigation, occur. Incident readiness helps any business better prepare for a potential data breach or ethical hack. By determining ahead of time the specific data that should be made available in the event of a breach, forensic investigators can draw more accurate conclusions on missing information, how the breach was executed and the security implications. Jones will review a Web application attack against two systems: one with default audit logging settings versus another that has undergone a forensic readiness engagement. Acting as an incident response specialist, Jones will compare the evidence in both attack scenarios and the contrasting resulting final reports, demonstrating how accurate evidence leads to a far better understanding of the compromise. With the ability to draw stronger conclusions about the attack, entities are able to react in a swift, targeted and measured way, reducing the impact of attacks, the cost to respond and any negative brand repercussions. \"Companies that consider incident readiness put their investigators in a much stronger position and can expect considerably more accurate conclusions from a forensic investigation,\" said John Yeo, director of SpiderLabs, EMEA. \"Data breaches can tarnish an organisation's reputation and consumer trust; engaging in incident readiness can help minimise the impact and provide the organisation a firmer response plan.\" About Trustwave Trustwave is a leading provider of on-demand and subscription-based information security and payment card industry compliance management solutions to businesses and government entities throughout the world. For organizations faced with today's challenging data security and compliance environment, Trustwave provides a unique approach with comprehensive solutions that include its flagship TrustKeeper(R) compliance management software and other proprietary security solutions including SIEM, WAF, EV SSL certificates and secure digital certificates.

More so over the pasty few months there has been a lot of fake and stupid operations being brewed up by trolls,\u00a0trouble\u00a0makers or just plain simple dumbass's. One of the most recent ones is once again asking people to download the well known stupid,\u00a0noneffective\u00a0tool called LOIC, this is the same tool that has seen so many people arrested and facing charges for taking part in\u00a0previous\u00a0attacks. This stupid operations have been inciting outrageous \u00a0actions towards the targets that have been in line from street\u00a0protesters, from this attacks or even the word of them people are making it alot harder for them who are making the effort and standing ground at there local protest or even travelling great distances to join others to stand ground. Now there is not a lot we can do about these fake attack operations but we can always help spread the word to everyone with interest and to other media to ignore calls for such operations like facebook, wallstreet cyber attacks, and many many more Some time these cyber attacks can have mroe trouble then they staty and specially for the street protestors, These attacks which seem to always get labled as\u00a0terrorism\u00a0activity seem to increase ground activity of police as well, What im asking is for everyone to\u00a0ignore\u00a0mass operations that call for you to download and use programs or participate in any types of cyber attacks and to spread the word and remind all your online friends/family\u00a0to do the same and stay away from this crap. /end rant :)"},

{"text": "MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. - War has been waged throughout history, and new tactics and technology emerge to provide an upper hand against one\u2019s opposition. Unremitting innovations of one\u2019s combative tools and elements are reactive and proactive measures that address the evolving wares and strategies of the adversary in order to maintain dominance and win the battle. In this day and age, the Internet has become the battlefield in a cyber war, and hackers, armed with computer viruses, prove to be an asymmetric threat difficult to defend against. On May 8, 2000, the Department of Defense reported that four of their classified networks were infected with the \u201clove bug\u201d virus. It is estimated that the email virus caused some $10 billion in losses in as many as 20 countries. Although the DOD has some of the best defenses against cyber attacks, the possibility of having its systems infiltrated remain. The Marine Corps Installation East Cyber Security Division is constantly working to prevent Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune\u2019s network cyber security from being compromised. \u201cEight years ago we had around 60 to 70 (cyber) attacks a year,\u201d said Sean Gilligan, information technician with Cyber Security Division, MCB Camp Lejeune. \u201cNow, we\u2019d be lucky to see less than one in a day.\u201d Viruses can be used to gain access to networks to obtain information. The variety of avenues to spread malware only makes infiltration of systems of any kind easier. \u201cWe can only do so much to protect and prevent an infiltration of our system,\u201d said Seth Thigpen, information technician with Cyber Security Division, MCB Camp Lejeune. \u201cIt\u2019s also the users\u2019 responsibility to make sure malware doesn\u2019t find its way onto our (government computers).\u201d Thigpen said there are programs that exploit vulnerabilities or crack passwords called root-kits to gain access to a network without being detected by antivirus software. Once a root-kit is installed, it allows the attacker to mask the intrusion, gain access to the computer and possibly other machines on the network. Thigpen said he actually had a root-kit infiltrate his personal computer. The Marine Corps has implemented cyber awareness training courses on MarineNet to include, Information Assurance Awareness training and Personally Identifiable Information and Careless Keystrokes Can Kill. These courses cover topics such as official use of government computers, recognizing suspicious emails and how devices, such as thumb drives and phones, should never be connected to government computers. \u201cAnyone\u2019s phone could have an embedded virus,\u201d said Thigpen. \u201cJust because you don\u2019t see it, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there. You could plug your phone to a computer and cause an infection. If someone decides to plug up their phone (to a government computer), we\u2019ll see it and they\u2019ll receive a call from us.\u201d The Cyber Security Division is constantly monitoring the activity on all of MCB Camp Lejeune\u2019s government computers. \u201cWe see everything,\u201d said Jason Norris, information technician with Cyber Security Division, MCB Camp Lejeune. \u201cWe can see all the websites you\u2019ve visited, the emails you\u2019ve sent and we can even see the type of phone you have when you plug to one our computers.\u201d Cyber Security staff said they track all activity and even though many people think they\u2019re getting away with the misuse of government computers and a government network, they\u2019re only building themselves a record of discrepancies while security staff is busy catching bigger fish. They added that there has been a large decline in the number of discrepancies recorded. In order to improve the cyber security, the proper use of the computers and networks must be enforced. Cyber Security staff asks users to help protect the network by watching out for suspicious activity, updating their government computers and completing and understanding all of the required cyber awareness training. \u201cWe also provide free antivirus software to all military personnel to help protect their person computers,\u201d said Gilligan. \u201cThere are also (patrons) who e-mail themselves work to do at home, and this keeps both government and personal computers protected from malware when documents are exchanged.\u201d The MCI East Cyber Security Division mission is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all data. User awareness is also important to maintaining and increasing network security, and the combined effort from the Cyber Security Division and Marine Corps network users will promote efficient proactive and reactive responses to threats. The Cyber Security Division will be hosting the annual Information Assurance Cyber Awareness Training at the Base Theater, Nov. 2 through 4. Military personnel can obtain free antivirus software at"},

Mr Vladimir bought a pair of Dolce and Gabbana shoes, flip flops and swimming shorts totalling \u20ac480 and had the items delivered to another address. Once Mr Mastrolani realized his internet connection was being used by his neighbour he waited for his credit card statement and found out about these extra charges that Mr Vladimir has been doing and notified police. Mr Vladimir Legal aid said he would of never been able to afford these any other way and he was fully regretful of the incident and said it should never of happened and was a big mistake and has since repaid the neighbour back. Magistrate Grima jailed him for eight months suspended for one year after taking into consideration his clean police record, his early admission and the fact that the money had been returned. So this shows that some countries still have fairly reasonable cyber crime laws and that they are not like many other that will throw u in jail for using a simple tool, so maybe so of these countries may want to have a look at the Romanian cyber crime laws and the way they handle incidents that we have been seeing over the past months."},

{"text": "Found Weaknesses in information security policies and practices at 24 major federal agencies continue to place the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and information systems at risk. Consistent with this risk, reports of security incidents from federal agencies are on the rise, increasing over 650 percent over the past 5 years. Each of the 24 agencies reviewed had weaknesses in information security controls (see figure). An underlying reason for these weaknesses is that agencies have not fully implemented their information security programs. As a result, they have limited assurance that controls are in place and operating as intended to protect their information resources, thereby leaving them vulnerable to attack or compromise. In reports for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, GAO and agency inspectors general have made hundreds of recommendations to agencies for actions necessary to resolve control deficiencies and information security program shortfalls. Agencies generally agreed with most of GAO\u2019s recommendations and indicated that they would implement them. Information Security Weaknesses at Major Federal Agencies for Fiscal Year 2010 OMB, agencies, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology took actions intended to improve the implementation of security requirements, but more work is necessary. Beginning in fiscal year 2009, OMB provided agencies with a new online tool to report their information security postures and, in fiscal year 2010, instituted the use of new and revised metrics. Nevertheless, OMB\u2019s guidance for those metrics did not always provide performance targets for measuring improvement. In addition, weaknesses were identified in the processes agencies used to implement requirements. Specifically, agencies did not always ensure (1) personnel with significant responsibilities received training; (2) security controls were monitored continuously; (3) weaknesses were remediated effectively; and (4) incidents were resolved in a timely manner, among other areas. Until hundreds of recommendations are implemented and program weaknesses are corrected, agencies will continue to face challenges in securing their information and information systems"},

{"text": "So, October has been classed as National Cybersecurity Awareness... pretty lame if you ask me and even worse its the 8th one. \u00a0Over the past few days security based media and even non security based media have been reporting all kinds of stuff on this CSAM. Well its my time now and im about to try explain why this is a pure waste of time, money, resources and overall its just stupid. First of all over the past couple of years we have seen a huge jump in cyber security attacks with them coming from all corners of the world for all reasons. We have also seen a lot of different\u00a0country's\u00a0merging and teaming up with security firms and other governments to try and prevent this from happening. We have seen planned \"controlled\" attacks to see how it effects certain things, and all this\u00a0is\u00a0what is a waste of money.\u00a0If they spent the money on proper funding for cyber security training, hired real developers and put in place something that will stop one developer charging\u00a0really\u00a0big $$ for work another will do for small $$. The problem is much bigger then basic security, it comes down to scammers, frauds, untrained people or people who really think they can do it and do or just lazy programming. As we seen with the\u00a0Sony\u00a0attacks, they was possible due to the\u00a0administration\u00a0not updating the software that had well known exploits that any kid could copy and paste after discovering that the server runs that out-dated software, and this alone is a worry. The\u00a0company's\u00a0and governments we\u00a0entrust\u00a0our data to should be held accountable for any insecurity the system they offer has, much like a car\u00a0warranty, if you by a brand new car and you are in a minor crash you expect to be not to hurt, by chance if you die\u00a0because\u00a0the car\u00a0manufacturer\u00a0didn't\u00a0properly check the cars\u00a0structural\u00a0then they would be held liable for the death and this\u00a0is\u00a0no different to a programmer who is to lazy to secure a form or put a command in to update software that results in security\u00a0breaches. If people can go to jail for so called \"hacking\" then we should be able to hold the programmers who allowed this to happen just as accountable as well. The government will be wasting\u00a0millions\u00a0on the month for the advertising and marketing of it, but what is the actually outcome of it besides telling everyone its National Cybersecurity Awareness month?"},

Now this is sort of a follow up on a recent article about the national cyber security awareness month and the waste of money it is and that they could do better things, this is much the same, why\u00a0doesn't\u00a0the US coast\u00a0guard\u00a0put the money into creating a team of experts that are not contracted from a\u00a0third\u00a0party civilian division. I can see that by having a\u00a0third\u00a0party division there will be not as much personal care to the job, lack of commitment and overall\u00a0laziness.

Ghost (Daniel Stevens) 21 didn't live in America/U.K But a small country with small population. I won't be releasing this country for obvious reasons, I spoke to his roommate who wishes to stay anonymous he told me that Ghost kept to himself, nice guy irl some average man. Ghost carried out a few operations, such as #opWestdorset#opLiladelman#opSouthAfrica#opPhilippines#opBrazilTAX'z#opEmbassyAnd many more. He worked alone, yet I made software for him now and then, simple scanners.. He did all the coding and hacking himself, there was another guy called _St0rm cept he didnt really help ghost much only really showed him a few vulns for high profile websites...

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 NASA satellites were interfered with four separate times in 2007 and 2008, possibly by the Chinese military, according to a draft of an upcoming report for the US Congress. The latest draft of the report by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission said the computer hackers behind the interference gained the ability to issue commands to one of the satellites on two occasions. The targeted satellites are used for observation of the earth's climate and terrain, according to the report to be submitted to Congress on November 16. A copy of the latest draft of the report was obtained by AFP on Thursday. It said the account of the interference with the satellites came from a May 2011 briefing for the Commission by the US Air Force. The hackers appear to have exploited the information systems of the Svalbard Satellite Station (SvalSat), a commercially operated satellite ground station in Spitsbergen, Norway, to gain access to the satellites, the report said. SvalSat relies on the Internet for data access and file transfers, it said, citing a recent National Aeronautics and Space Administration report. On October 20, 2007, Landsat-7, a US earth observation satellite jointly managed by NASA and the US Geological Survey, experienced 12 or more minutes of interference, the report said. Landsat-7 experienced another 12 or more minutes of interference on July 23, 2008, the report said. It said that on June 20, 2008, Terra EOS AM-1, a NASA-managed program for earth observation, experienced two or more minutes of interference, it said. It said the hackers behind the interference with Terra EOS AM-1 \"achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands.\" On October 22, 2008, Terra EOS AM-1 experienced nine or more minutes of interference, the report said, and \"the responsible party\" again \"achieved all steps required to command the satellite but did not issue commands.\" \"Such interference poses numerous potential threats, particularly if achieved against satellites with more sensitive functions,\" the report said. \"For example, access to a satellite's controls could allow an attacker to damage or destroy the satellite,\" the commission said. \"The attacker could also deny or degrade as well as forge or otherwise manipulate the satellite's transmission,\" it said. \"A high level of access could reveal the satellite's capabilities or information, such as imagery, gained through its sensors.\" The report stressed that it was not recounting the incidents \"on the basis of specific attribution information\" but rather \"because the techniques appear consistent with authoritative Chinese military writings.\" \"Authoritative Chinese military writings advocate for such activities, particularly as they relate to ground-based space infrastructure, such as satellite control facilities,\" the report said. The draft report also accused China of being behind a \"range of malicious cyber activities\" including state-level involvement in cyberattacks, industrial espionage and the compromise of US and foreign government computer systems. \"In 2011, US and foreign government organizations, defense contractors, commercial entities, and various nongovernmental organizations experienced a substantial volume of network intrusions and attempts with various ties to China,\" the report said. China has repeatedly denied any state involvement in cyberattacks against government agencies and firms, including well-publicized attacks on Internet giant Google that sparked a row between Washington and Beijing."},

{"text": "The computer virus used in targeted attacks against Japanese diplomatic missions overseas was designed to transmit identification data and other information from infected computers to two servers in China, it has been learned. One of the two servers in China is registered at a domain that was also used in cyber-attacks against online search giant Google in 2009-2010, sources said Thursday. This and other circumstantial evidence suggests the virus is part of international espionage efforts targeting classified Japanese diplomatic information. The virus has infected dozens of computers at Japanese diplomatic offices in 10 countries, including the Japanese Embassy in South Korea, since this summer. According to sources close to the case, the virus is called \"BKDR_AGENT.MOF.\" The virus can make infected personal computers transmit information, such as user IDs and Internet protocol addresses, to outside parties. The virus can also forcibly activate software programs on infected PCs. Several servers were assigned as destinations for data transmissions caused by the virus, and at least two have been found to be located in China. The two servers are registered at rental domains administered by a Chinese company. The sources said one of the domains has been involved in numerous previous cyber-attacks, including the spate of cyber-attacks known as Operation Aurora that targeted about 30 companies between 2009 and 2010. Google was one of the companies attacked. People who wish to use the domain must fill out an online application in Chinese. Most users of the domain therefore have knowledge of the Chinese language, the sources said. It has also been discovered that the virus is designed to direct infected computers to attach codes to its data transmissions, one of which is \"mofa.\" MOFA is a common acronym for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the official name of the Foreign Ministry."},

This report concludes that initiative to secure utilities' infrastructure will increase investment in cyber security systems to\u00a0$14.0 billion\u00a0by 2018. As per Pike Research; The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has begun issuing fines for non-compliance with its CIP reliability standards. Utilities believe that they will see greater benefits from Distribution Automation than from Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Pike Research's forecasts indicate greater spending in that area. Much has changed for the positive. Unfortunately, one thing has not changed. Cyber security is still way behind the attackers. \u00a0Even where strong countermeasures exist, they are not consistently deployed. \u00a0More sophisticated attackers look at smart grids from a systemic perspective while often the defenses have been installed in piecemeal fashion, without an architecture. This hands an enormous advantage to the attackers. This Pike Research report assesses the threats and vulnerabilities that confront smart grid technologies, to arrive at an analysis of the most significant cyber security investments and market opportunities. The report includes a detailed examination of key market drivers and barriers, along with profiles of key industry players and global forecasts, segmented by region and application area, for smart grid cyber security revenue through 2018. Pike Research is a market research and consulting firm that provides in-depth analysis of global clean technology markets.

{"text": "Representatives of 60 nations will gather in London in an attempt to secure the benefits of the internet amid concern about rising levels of cyber attacks and online crime. Foreign Secretary William Hague has called for a \"collective endeavour\" to ensure the \"enormous potential\" of cyberspace for developing a safer, more prosperous world is fully realised. Britain wants to develop a set of international \"rules of the road\", establishing \"norms of acceptable behaviour\" in cyberspace, while stopping short of a full treaty advocated by some countries. Behind the scenes, however, there are tensions, and Baroness Neville-Jones, the Prime Minister's special representative to business on cyber security, on Monday publicly accused China and Russia - who are both attending the conference - of carrying out cyber warfare attacks aimed at stealing national security secrets from other countries. Meanwhile the head of Britain's secret electronic \"listening\" agency, GCHQ, has disclosed that a \"significant\" attempt was made to penetrate the computer systems of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and other Government departments over the summer. Iain Lobban did not say who was involved although Mr Hague has previously said a \"hostile state intelligence agency\" targeted the FCO system earlier in the year, with media reports quoting intelligence sources as saying China was responsible. With cybercrime estimated to cost 1 trillion US dollars (\u00a3600 billion) a year worldwide, Mr Lobban said the \"disturbing\" levels of illegal activity online represent \"a very real threat to our prosperity\". Mr Hague said: \"How to ensure we can all reap the benefits of a safe and secure cyberspace for generations to come is one of the greatest challenges we face. The response does not lie in the hands of any one government or country but it is too important to be left to chance. This needs to be a collective endeavour, involving all those who have a stake in cyberspace. \"The ideas and proposals we hope to emerge from the conference will develop into the 'London Agenda' - an inclusive and focused approach to help us realise the enormous potential cyberspace offers for a more prosperous, safe and open networked world.\" US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was due to attend the conference, cancelled the trip after her mother, 92-year-old Dorothy Rodham, became ill.

A Europe-based holding company engaged Cybrix Group to perform a complete security audit and vulnerability assessment at several of its wholly-owned investment companies. These organizations represent significant worldwide holdings and investments, so the risk of potential breach is high; financial organizations are traditionally a favorite target of malicious activities and hacking. Cybrix Group used a combination of commercially available and proprietary strategies and techniques to test every aspect of the client\u2019s data, network, and physical information security. Of its decision to seek professional assistance before a threat was detected, Cybrix Group\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Phil DuMas says, \u201cThese clients realized that preventive measures are better than remediation. By assessing all potential vulnerabilities, we were able to help them take the necessary steps to correct security weaknesses before they were exploited. These steps will significantly strengthen the financial security of our client, its significant investments, its clients\u2019 security and its reputation. We wish all organizations would be so proactive; that would do a lot to undermine the impact hackers make on businesses today.\u201d About Cybrix Group \u2013 The Cybrix Group, Inc. is a Tampa, Florida based information technology services and security firm that specializes in building, testing, managing and maintaining all types of networks.

Williams said the students in the program have learned to be careful with online activity. Recently, a study of more than 2,000 users of Facebook, released by CCPGroup, an international marketing services business, found that more than a third of Facebook users had sensitive information on their pages that could be used to hack their bank accounts or other financial services. Often, information entered on Facebook by its users is involved in some of its most popular features. An example would be its popular birthday notification. That\u2019s a problem, says Williams. \u201cYour date of birth\u2014even a partial date, such as the day and month\u2014is used as an identifier at your bank and in other important records,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhile we all want to wish our friends a happy birthday, and enjoy being wished a happy birthday, it won\u2019t be all that happy if someone uses the information to steal your identity.\u201d Other security measures one needs to keep in mind when using Facebook, according to the Rose State cyber sleuths, include:"},

{"text": "Melbourne, Australia (PRWEB) November 03, 2011 Senetas Corporation is attending government information security conferences on both sides of the planet, offering its world-leading high speed data protection solutions based on encryption. Senetas CEO, John DuBois said the company\u2019s European office is participating in the London Conference on Cyberspace hosted by the Secretary of State for Foreign & Commonwealth Affairs, the Rt Hon William Hague MP. Last week Senetas in Australia was major sponsor and presented at the Cyber Security for Government 2011 conference in Sydney, at which it suggested security should be treated like quality and safety. The London Conference on Cyberspace, attended by representatives from 60 nations, began one day after British intelligence agency GCHQ warned of \u201cdisturbing levels\u201d of cyber-attacks targeting sensitive data on government computers. The event was designed to launch a more focused and inclusive dialogue between key cyberspace actors from across the world including from government, industry and civil society. It aimed to \u201cdevelop a better collective understanding of how to protect and preserve the tremendous opportunities that the development of cyberspace offers us all\u201d and covered five themes: economic growth and development, social benefits, cybercrime, safe and reliable access, and international security The Sydney conference was focused on how government and business could improve cyber security and mitigate cybercrime. Mr DuBois said the collective experience of the Senetas team in Australia and Europe provided valuable input to both conferences based on the company\u2019s 12 years of providing data protection by encryption to governments, defence and commercial organisations. Speaking at the Sydney event, Stuart Bell, General Manager, Product Sales for Australia and New Zealand said that security should ultimately be treated the same as quality and safety: \u201c\u2026ideas that moved from a cost-based approach to a business differentiator and then matured into just how you do business\u201d. Mr Bell said broad-based adoption came when organisations realised that safety was \u201cgood for business, good for employees and the business community\u2026clearly security is the next wave \u2013 and Senetas has a simple twist on an old concept: KISS (Keep It Simply Secure)\u201d. \u201cIn our role working with international governments and their agencies we are well aware of the latest cyber threats; we fully understand how overwhelming this could be to those charged with managing the transmission of confidential and sensitive corporate or personal information around the enterprise, or around the world. \u201cOrganisations must now draw a line in the sand, adopt a zero trust approach and create the future secure environment then migrate trust participants into it. You need to act now whilst your business is still in motion \u2013 or it may be too late,\u201d Mr Bell warned. Mr DuBois said Senetas would continue to take opportunities to attend key strategic events at which it could speak directly to key influencers of decisions around government and business information security. About Senetas Senetas Corporation Limited (ASX Code: SEN) is an Australian ASX-listed public company and is the world\u2019s leading developer and supplier of high speed network encryption hardware products. Senetas encryption technology has been independently tested and accredited by the world\u2019s leading agencies and now offers the only dual accredited encryption hardware - certified to both FIPS 140-2 Level 3 and Common Criteria EAL4+ and currently in evaluation for CESG CAPS certification in United Kingdom.

{"text": "NEW YORK, Nov. 4, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- For the first time, Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly) will open the doors to its Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) to all students interested in digital privacy and security - not just the so-called \"cyber ninjas\" who qualified as national finalists in feats of digital forensics, ethical hacking and research. The eighth annual CSAW finals - joined for the first time by Kaspersky's American Cup at NYU-Poly - will be held Nov. 10-11, 2011, on NYU-Poly's downtown Brooklyn campus. It is expected to attract up to 400 student finalists, professionals, academics and guests. Student guests may register for the conference hosted by Kaspersky Lab; a career fair including some of the country's most prestigious employers of cyber security; a chance to win cash prizes of up to $1,000 and NYU-Poly scholarships of up to $5,000 in the fast-paced Quiz Tournament; and networking opportunities with internationally recognized security professionals and accomplished scholars from high school through doctoral programs. Student guests may also watch the various challenges and listen to presentations by some of the best young researchers in the field who will be competing in the AT&T Research Paper Award Challenge as well as the Kaspersky American Cup Challenge. CSAW will close with an awards ceremony with keynote speaker Don Proctor, Cisco senior vice president and leader of its Cybersecurity Task Force. All events are free of charge but registration is required at"},
{"text": ". \"We are encouraging all university students to join us during CSAW to explore cyber security as a course of study that is challenging and increasingly important to society,\" said Nasir Memon, director of NYU-Poly's cyber security program. \"Our students who lead the CSAW challenges have always worked to ensure that excitement and fun are part of the formula that makes NYU-Poly's cyber security games different. This year, Kaspersky Lab's conference will complement the 'awareness' element of CSAW, and NYU-Poly will expand its outreach to reach more high school students at the time they are making important decisions on their educational paths.\" The need for cyber security professionals is fierce: Government officials have estimated that 30,000 highly skilled professionals are needed but only 1,000 exist. Electrical engineering, computer engineering and computer science - all paths of entry into the field -- rank among the ten undergraduate college majors that lead to the highest salaries by PayScale.com. The NYU-Poly CSAW challenges are among the oldest and broadest student-led competitions, and encourage awareness of the increasing threats to privacy and security issues for individuals, governments, business and smart infrastructure. The difficult challenges and the final round of competitions encourage students to build networks with others in the field to help keep abreast of the fast-changing knowledge base. The elimination rounds attracted a record number of participants, with finalists winning travel to New York to participate in the finals. Challenges include the Quiz Tournament; High School Cyber Forensics Challenge; Capture the Flag Application Security Challenge, a software hacking competition; the Embedded Systems Challenge, which covers hardware hacking and security; the NYU-Poly AT&T Best Applied Security Paper Award for published student research; the Kaspersky American Cup Challenge at NYU-Poly's CSAW for research; and the Security Awareness Video contest. NYU-Poly was one of the earliest schools to introduce a cyber security program, receiving National Security Agency (NSA) approval a decade ago. Designated as both a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and a Center of Academic Excellence in Research by the NSA, the school houses a National Science Foundation-funded Information Systems and Internet Security Laboratory, the nerve center of cyber security research. The Sloan Consortium, an affiliation of educators and institutions dedicated to quality online education, named NYU-Poly's cyber security program as the Outstanding Online Program for 2011. NYU-Poly is also expanding the field of inquiry through an innovative cyber security program for graduate and doctoral students that addresses social aspects of privacy and security such as law, business, government policy and psychology. Its CSAW experience with high schools will lead to a new program next year for high schools. It will include training for high school teachers, summer boot camp and a web portal to network and support emerging talent. The importance of cyber security education is evidenced by the CSAW sponsor list: AT&T, AccessData, Booz Allen Hamilton, Cisco, Facebook, Gotham Digital Science, Hewlett-Packard Company, Huawei, Intel, International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants, Kaspersky Lab, Lockheed Martin, Matasano, National Science Foundation, Raytheon, Research In Motion, Sandia National Laboratories, State Street, Stroz Friedberg, U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, U.S. Army Research Office, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Xilinx.

This is why caution is so critical, to avoid the possible erosion of our free, open society.\" Occupy Privacy supports the efforts by the German Data Protection Authority to expose practices where social networks unlawfully track users. The campaign also support the efforts by the Data Protection Commissioner of Ireland to investigate companies accused of creating shadow profiles on people.

{"text": "By Gerry J. Gilmore American Forces Press Service ARLINGTON, Va., Nov. 7, 2011 \u2013 Senior Defense Department officials and members of the information technology industry met here today to discuss how to better protect military and commercial cyberspace. The potential capability for cyber mayhem makes cyber security \u201cone of the most intense challenges of our time,\u201d Regina E. Dugan, director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, told hundreds of audience members who gathered at a hotel here for DARPA\u2019s one-day \u201cCyber Colloquium.\u201d The Internet has fueled advancements and opportunities in business, medicine and other spheres, said Army Gen. Keith B. Alexander, commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency on Fort Meade, Md.. However, he added, protecting networks from information theft or attack by hackers is a big job. \u201cWhen you look at the vulnerabilities that we face in this area, it\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d Alexander said. Government and commercial networks worldwide have experienced repeated assault by hackers over the past several years, he noted. \u201cWhat we see is a disturbing trend, from exploitation to disruption to destruction,\u201d Alexander said. DOD views cyberspace as a domain such as air, land, sea and space, the general said. New and better ways must be developed in partnership with private industry to defend the nation\u2019s military and commercial information networks, he said. First, the Defense Department is looking at creating special \u201chunter teams\u201d to actively look for computer viruses and malware, Alexander said. Such teams, he added, would be part of \u201ca dynamic\u201d perimeter-defense network. DOD also can do more, he \u00a0said, to partner with private industry, as well as allies, to protect the cyber realm. Another change that would upgrade the military\u2019s cyber defense and save money, Alexander \u00a0said, is adapting cloud computing platforms. In cloud computing, applications are accessed from Internet web browsers rather than being installed on each individual computer server. Remote servers are used to store organizational data and information. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to secure the cloud \u2026 [and] it\u2019s cheaper,\u201d he said, noting a test program demonstrates potential DOD information technology savings of 30 percent by using the cloud network system. The Internet\u2019s birth 40 years ago created both great opportunities and risks for society, said Dugan, noting that DARPA was heavily involved in its creation. Today, people around the globe rely on the Internet for communication, information, commerce and entertainment purposes, she said. However, cyber criminals steal information worth millions of dollars from businesses worldwide each year, Dugan said. In fact, she added, 2004 marked the first time that proceeds from cyber crime exceeded profits made from the sale of illegal drugs. \u201cMalicious cyber attacks are not merely an existential threat to our bits and bytes,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cThey are a real threat to an increasingly large number of systems that we interact with daily, from the power grid to our financial systems to our automobiles and our military systems.\u201d Former Deputy Defense Secretary \u00a0William J. Lynn III said on Sept. 28 that cyber attacks would become a significant component of future conflicts and that more than 30 nations are creating cyber units in their militaries, Dugan said. Lynn added that it would be unrealistic to think that these nations would confine their cyber capabilities to only defensive purposes, she said. Today, a connected, motivated group operating through the Internet can accomplish tasks in a frightfully short period of time, Dugan said. Accordingly, Dugan said, in the fiscal year 2012 budget submission, DARPA increased its cyber threat research budget by $88 million. \u201cAnd over the next five years our proposed investment in cyber research will grow steadily, from 8 to 12 percent of our top line,\u201d she added. In coming years, she said, DARPA will focus an increasing portion of its cyber research on the investigation of offensive [cyber] capabilities to address military-specific needs."},

{"text": "Wrapped in the code used to infect computers is an \"Easter egg,\" or a hidden message. Easter eggs have long been inserted in computer code, often seen only by those who enjoy browsing computer code. Duqu's exploit, the code used to take advantage of a software vulnerability, contained the line: \"Copyright (c) 2003 Showtime Inc. All rights reserved. DexterRegularDexter.\" The reference to the television show \"Dexter\" is meant as a joke. The shellcode of the exploit is contained in an embedded font called \"DexterRegularDexter,\" which is processed by Windows' Win32k TrueType font parsing engine,"},
{"text": ", a senior analyst with the Global Research and Analysis Team for Kaspersky Lab. \"This is another prank pulled by the Duqu authors,\" he wrote. There actually is no font called Dexter, though, and it is just a name the malware authors assigned to the file, said Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team. Kaspersky and many other computer security companies have been analyzing Duqu since it surfaced. Duqu shares some similarities with Stuxnet, the malware believed to have been created with the intention of disrupting Iran's nuclear program by tampering with centrifuges used to enrich uranium. But experts remain uncertain if there is a connection between the developers of the two pieces of malware. Gostev's latest write up is an analysis of a version of Duqu that came from Sudan's CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team), which had a sample of Duqu from an unnamed organization that was infected. Victims are infected by an exploit delivered via a tampered Microsoft Word document, which, if opened, delivers Duqu. Gostev's post includes a screenshot of the simple email purporting to come from a marketing manager, \"Mr. B. Jason,\" requesting that the receiver open a Word document and answer a few questions such as \"Do you supply marine shipping?\" Other clues in the code have indicated that Duqu could be as much as 4 years old. A driver loaded by Duqu's exploit into the Windows kernel has a date saying it was compiled on Aug. 31, 2007, Gostev wrote. But that may not be accurate, since Duqu has different components that could have been created at different times. Another oddity discovered by Kaspersky is how often attacks occurred on Wednesdays. \"The Duqu gang has an affinity for Wednesdays,\"Raiu said. \"They have repeatedly attempted to steal information from these systems on Wednesdays. This probably indicates a strong routine, almost military type.\" The attackers also took a lot of care when they struck to avoid being detected. They used separate command-and-control servers for each unique set of files.

{"text": "A computer virus disabled the automated response system of St John communication centres across the country this week. Ambulance communications operations manager Alan Goudge said systems were back up and running yesterday morning after being attacked by the virus on Wednesday night. The incident forced staff to allocate ambulances manually but it is still unknown if any emergency call-outs were affected. \"Anti-virus software protected the systems but as a result of the virus it impacted on some of the systems services, mainly those related to paging and radio. Back-up systems immediately took over when it was detected and the workload was managed manually,\" Mr Goudge said. Mr Goudge said the source of the virus was still being investigated. \"While it has now been contained we are looking into how and why it entered our system.\" A Hamilton IT expert, who did not wish to be named, said he was surprised by the outage in an emergency call centre and said he expected a robust system to be heavily protected by computer security systems. \"Without forensic access to the system it's hard to gauge what went on, however in most cases a virus is transferred from a memory stick plugged into the system,\" he said. \"One would expect a system like this to have strict controls around memory stick use.\" A memory stick was responsible for introducing the Conficker virus to Waikato District Health Board computers in December 2009. The virus disabled the system for two days, affecting more than 6000 staff and thousands of patients who had procedures delayed while the problem was fixed. When St John receives a 111 emergency call an ambulance is alerted via a mobile data terminal (MDT) linked to a paging system. The MDT, similar to an on-board computer, displays information about the emergency, including what and where it is. But during this week's outage, ambulance officers were in some cases called via station phones and emergency information was relayed in person. St John had not received any reports that emergency response times were affected, but Mr Goudge said the organisation was investigating the impact the disruption had on the service. \"Any responses of concern that result from the investigations will be followed up with patients and family involved,\" he said. Communication centres in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, that receive more than one million calls a year, were affected."},

In fact, we believe a thriving China is good for China, and a thriving China is good for America,\" Clinton said. \"President Obama and I have made very clear that the United States is fundamentally committed to developing a positive and cooperative relationship with China,\" she said. Referring to the Strategic and Economic Dialogue launched with China in 2009, Clinton said these are the most intensive and expansive talks ever conducted between the two sides. \"We look forward to traveling to Beijing this spring for the fourth round,\" she said. \"Now, we are looking to China to intensify dialogue between civilian and military officials through the Strategic Security Dialogue so we can have an open and frank discussions on the most sensitive issues in our relationship, including maritime security and cyber security,\" Clinton said. On the economic front, the US and China have to work together to ensure strong, sustained, balanced future global growth, she said, adding that US firms want fair opportunities to export to China's markets and a level playing field for competition. \"Chinese firms want to buy more high-tech products from us, make more investments in our country, and be accorded the same terms of access that market economies enjoy. We can work together on these objectives, but China needs to take steps to reform,\" she said. \"In particular, we are working with China to end unfair discrimination against US and other foreign companies, and we are working to protect innovative technologies, remove competition-distorting preferences,\" Clinton said and demanded that China must allow its currency to appreciate more rapidly and end the measures that disadvantage or pirate foreign intellectual property. \"We believe making these changes would provide a stronger foundation for stability and growth, both for China and for everyone else,\" she said."},

Wednesday night's operation stemmed from the complaint of AT&T, a US-based telecommunication company and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding the activities of Filipino hackers who hacked the system of AT&T. The hacking activity resulted in about US$2-million in losses incurred by the company, said Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (DILG) Director Samuel Pagdilao Jr. Pagdilao said operatives from the CIDG's Anti-Transnational and Cyber Crime Division (ATCCD) and FBI agents struck at several target areas in Metro Manila, resulting in the arrest of four suspects. Several computer and telecommunication equipment believed to be used by the suspects in their hacking activities were recovered. ATCCD chief Gilbert Sosa identified the arrested suspects as Macnell Gracilla, 31, of Carmen Rosales, Pangasinan and resident of Unit 5, Montiville Place, Greenville Subdivision, Sauyo, Quezon City; Francisco Manalac, 25, and his live-in partner Regina Balura, 21, both of 89 Sampaguita Extension, East Bagong Barrio, Calooocan City; and Paul Michael Kwan, 29, of 21 Hebrew St., West Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City. Sosa said that prior to Wednesday's arrest of Kwan, the suspect has been arrested in 2007 by Philippine authorities following the international crackdown launched by the FBI against suspected terrorist cells involved in financing terrorist activities. Sosa said FBI agents who have been investigating incessant hacking of telecommunication companies in the US and in the country since 1999 have uncovered paper trail of various bank transactions linking the local hackers to the Saudi-based cell whose activities include financing terrorist activities. Sosa said that in 2007, FBI operatives arrested Pakistani Jemaah Islamiyah member Muhammad Zamir in Italy. Zamir\u2019s group, who was later tagged by the FBI to be the financial source of the terrorist attack in Mubai, India in November 26, 2008, is also the same group that paid Kwan\u2019s group of hackers in Manila. Sosa said Kwan and the other hackers in Manila were being used by the Zamir's terrorists group to hack the trunk-line of different telecommunication companies including the AT&T. Revenues derived from the hacking activities of the Filipino-based hackers were diverted to the account of the terrorists, who paid the Filipino hackers on a commission basis via local banks. After Zamir's arrest in 2007, a Saudi-national took helm of the operation of the group, who also maintained its link with the group of Filipino hackers based in Manila. On March 2011, FBI authorities requested the CIDG-ATCCD assistance after they found out that the group has targeted the AT&T in the US and that the same group of Filipino hackers is involved. Pagdilao said the recent arrest of Filipino hackers tied to a group involved in financing terrorist activities should serve as a wake-up call to legislators to speed-up the passage of the Cyber Crime Prevention Bill now pending in Congress in order to address proactively the threat of cyber crime terrorists who have made the country their base of operations."},

{"text": "LOS ANGELES, Nov 23, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Harris & Ruble, a prominent class-action law firm based in Los Angeles, announced their November 16, 2011, filing of a class-action lawsuit against Sutter Medical Foundation and Sutter Physician Services, alleging the medical provider did not properly safeguard medical information for more than 4 million of its patients affected by the mid-October theft of a computer from the Sutter Medical Foundation headquarters. The suit was filed on the same day that Sutter admitted the unencrypted stolen computer contained patients' medical records. Sutter officials have acknowledged this is the largest data breach the health network has ever experienced as it impacts millions of patients seen in their facilities between 2005 and 2011. Filed in Alameda County Superior Court on behalf of plaintiff Javier Garcia, the class-action lawsuit alleges Sutter was negligent in protecting patient information stored in computer databases and failed to properly notify patients within the timeframes required by law. A month earlier - October 17, 2011 - a computer with unencrypted patient data was reported stolen from the administrative offices of the Sutter Medical Foundation. Patients first learned of the security breach from the media and did not receive notices from Sutter until late last week. Some 3.3 million patients with providers supported by Sutter Physician Services and 943,000 Sutter Medical Foundation patients are affected. The stolen data includes names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers, health insurance plans, and in some cases, descriptions of medical diagnoses or procedures. The Defendants \"utterly failed to protect private medical information for the millions of patients who entrusted their healthcare and private information to these companies,\" said attorney Alan Harris. \"Securing equipment and encrypting data were not a priority for Sutter and now patients will have to worry about what medical or insurance information is out there for others to view. That Pat Fry, Sutter Health President and CEO, has acknowledged his responsibility to work harder to protect such information in the future, does not excuse the failure to safeguard the confidential information that has already been disclosed.\" For additional information, patients impacted by this data breach may contact: Alan Harris Harris & Ruble 6424 Santa Monica Boulevard Los Angeles, CA 90038 (323) 962-3777"},

The contract award funds the continued development, fabrication and integration of a functional prototype that will be presented to DARPA and others at the completion of the project. \"We\u2019re very excited to be among the first to work with DARPA\u2019s CFT initiative. The program establishes the ability for firms like us to do meaningful research under a federal program, which would otherwise not be possible,\" said Matt Harrigan, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe truth is that attackers have adapted beyond today's security products. At Critical Assets, we demand defensive measures that our own white-hat hackers can't break. And that rules out most of the 'solutions' on the market today. Critical Assets Labs is pushing the envelope with new forms of defense. And we are developing novel counteroffensive measures to help deceive, identify and catch cybercriminals. As an industry, we need to be innovating as quickly as the bad guys. And our defensive measures should be raising the cost and risks to being a bad guy.\u201d Harrigan added. Critical Assets is intending to pursue a number of projects with DARPA under Cyber Fast Track, and the company is seeking additional researchers to be part of its CA Labs team. \u201cSecurity people have historically had to balance their security research with projects that they aren\u2019t emotionally invested in, which is less than ideal for them. The goal of Critical Assets Labs is to partner on programs like CFT to give researchers their utopian job,\u201d said Amy Kohtz of CA Labs.

{"text": "The Duqu Virus, which was discovered in computers around the world two months ago, may be a more serious threat to data security than previously thought. Computer scientists at the Kaspersky Lab in Moscow revealed yesterday that the way the virus went about attacking individual computers was much more complicated than it had been considered to be the case when it was first discovered. According to their findings, each of the eight concentrated attacks against the computer infrastructure of large companies around the world had been uniquely designed. All of the attacks included variations of fake email messages and Word documents, which, if opened, would trigger the virus via unique fonts that had been purposefully embedded in the documents by the creators of the virus. These modifications would take place immediately before an attack was to be launched and have proven difficult to detect. This kind of sophistication was not recognized during the initial examinations of the virus. According to a report published by the scientists and quoted in publications such as Computerworld and PC World, the creators of Duqu spent a number of years creating the virus. Traces of data sources going back to 2007 and 2008 are seen as evidence for that\u00a0Microsoft has confirmed that Duqu takes advantage of a deficiency within one of its model drivers, which allows the virus to temporarily gain access to a PC. Then, once opened, the virus installs itself automatically. The firm has not been able to fix this problem so far and is calling on users (especially IT professionals at large companies) to protect themselves by disabling certain font features. More information on this can be found on the technical support section of Microsoft\u2019s website."},

Similarities between Duqu and a malicious Stuxnet worm have prompted speculation that the same culprits might be involved, though no links have been proven. Duqu is similar to Stuxnet but is designed to gather intelligence for future attacks on industrial control systems. Stuxnet was designed to attack computer control systems made by German industrial giant Siemens and commonly used to manage water supplies, oil rigs, power plants and other critical infrastructure. Most Stuxnet infections have been discovered in Iran, giving rise to speculation it was intended to sabotage nuclear facilities there. The worm was crafted to recognise the system it was designed to attack. The New York Times reported in January that US and Israeli intelligence services collaborated to develop the computer worm to sabotage Iran's efforts to make a nuclear bomb."},

This effort is a critical part of the front line of defense against cyber threats as outlined by President Obama and Cybersecurity coordinator Howard Schmidt. Once deployed, email authentication helps to increase the resiliency of the United States' infrastructure, including the ability to detect and block malicious email threats. OTA has created a curriculum that is being delivered through the CERT Program at the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (SEI) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for online delivery to federal employees. Email authentication is a key defensive cybersecurity tool for the public and private sector to aid in the detection of malicious and deceptive email. This initiative reflects DHS's commitment to accelerating best practices in cyber-security and supporting the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), and will allow federal employees to better protect agencies, employees and U.S. citizens. \"Email authentication is the front line defense for the escalating levels of spear phishing targeting government agencies and businesses which is undermining the trust and confidence of online services,\" said Craig Spiezle, executive director and president, Online Trust Alliance. \"This program, supported by the White House, will help stem the tide of malicious and deceptive email. This is a great example of the public and private sector working together to help increase end-to-end trust of our nation's critical infrastructure.\" Such threats as spear-phishing target business executives, senior level officials and political figures by forging a known and trusted sender's email address in order to get the recipient to open the malicious email and install malware. Once deployed, the cybercriminals attempt to compromise systems with multiple forms of malware including zero-day exploits, to gain credentials giving them access to proprietary and sensitive data or the ability to monitor user's online activities. Email Authentication emerged in 2003 from several industry efforts seeking to address the rising tide of spam and forged email. Using either email authentication technology that resulted, DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) or Sender Policy Framework (SPF), or both, is recognized as an online security best practice by the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Senate, and leading industry trade organizations. Both SPF and DKIM provide ways for email senders to take responsibility for the email they send, and for receivers to validate that the purported sender is valid and not forged. Based on research released by OTA in October 2011, adoption by leading Federal agencies has increased to 40% -- up from 32% from April 2010.(1) This training is being delivered by industry experts from OTA staff and member companies including AG Interactive, Agari and Return Path. These companies and their employees have completed rigorous certification testing and real-world deployments working with leading ISPs, businesses and government agencies. About The Online Trust Alliance: OTA's mission is to develop and advocate best practices, training and public policy which mitigate emerging privacy, identity and security threats to online services, brands, government, organizations and consumers. OTA's goal is to increase consumer protection, transparency and control of their data and online activities, thereby enhancing online trust and confidence and the long-term vitality and innovation of Internet based services.

Cyber Endeavor is the United States European Command's paramount cyber security collaboration, familiarization and engagement program designed to strengthen partner nation cyber defense capacities through seminars, events and exercises. Cyber Endeavor builds partnerships with NATO, partner nations, academia and industry. During Cyber Endeavor 2011, BreakingPoint cyber range solutions were among those used to conduct exercises to help harden network defenses, conduct advanced cyber security research, validate lawful intercept systems and train cyber warriors. Cyber Endeavor uses BreakingPoint to test network defenses, lawful intercept systems and cyber warrior skills BreakingPoint cyber range products were also used to validate the resiliency of mission-critical lawful intercept systems, which are used to legally analyze data to prevent possible infrastructure or cyber attacks. Cyber Endeavor attendees participated in a hands-on exercise with BreakingPoint experts to learn the basics of lawful intercept systems and how to test their accuracy in the face of stressful network conditions. By creating the behavior of millions of users, participants could create \"needle in a haystack\" scenarios using blended applications, live cyber attacks and malformed traffic. The lawful intercept system was then hit with this real-world traffic to validate its ability to accurately identify keyword triggers under these hostile conditions. The BreakingPoint cyber range solution was used throughout Cyber Endeavor, including to: -- Test and validate the performance, security and stability of critical network infrastructure and network equipment devices. -- Demonstrate how to configure and use Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD) for cyber defense solutions. -- Determine the accuracy of real-time application traffic decoding probes using Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD). Create Internet-Scale Cyber War Conditions \"Cyber Endeavor truly supports cyber defense information exchange by bringing together participants from approximately 40 nations and organizations with the primary goal of gaining an understanding of the threats and knowledge on how to better defend and protect their networks and cyber domains. The participants collaborate and train on the most pressing cyber issues facing our collective communities,\" said William Poole, Cyber Endeavor organizer. \"Using the BreakingPoint cyber range technology, participants were able to create Internet-scale cyber war conditions in a controlled, compact and cost-effective environment. The ability to conduct accurate cyber war exercises not only helps train cyber warriors on how to prevent cyber attacks, but it also is used to harden current cyber defenses, validate lawful interception techniques and advance cyber security research across Europe.\" About BreakingPoint As the standard for IT resiliency, BreakingPoint gives you advance insight into the performance, security and stability of applications, devices, networks and data centers under high-stress conditions. BreakingPoint's patented products are comprehensive, easy to use and highly scalable, simulating the behavior of millions of online and mobile application users as they work, shop, post, stream, talk, download, spread malware and steal data. By stressing each element of IT infrastructures under these real-world conditions, BreakingPoint quickly and accurately exposes previously impossible-to-detect stress fractures before they are exploited.

{"text": "Greetings Pirates, and welcome to another exciting #FuckFBIFriday release. As part of our ongoing effort to expose and humiliate our white hat enemies, we targeted a Special Agent Supervisor of the CA Department of Justice in charge of computer crime investigations. We are leaking over 38,000 private emails which contain detailed computer forensics techniques, investigation protocols as well as highly embarrassing personal information. We are confident these gifts will bring smiles to the faces of our black hat brothers and sisters (especially those who have been targeted by these scurvy dogs) while also making a mockery of \"security professionals\" who whore their \"skills\" to law enforcement to protect tyrannical corporativism and the status quo we aim to destroy. We hijacked two gmail accounts belonging to Fred Baclagan, who has been a cop for 20 years, dumping his private email correspondence as well as several dozen voicemails and SMS text message logs. While just yesterday Fred was having a private BBQ with his CATCHTEAM high computer crime task force friends, we were reviewing their detailed internal operation plans and procedure documents. We also couldn't overlook the boatloads of embarrassing personal information about our cop friend Fred. We lulzed as we listened to angry voicemails from his estranged wives and ex-girlfriends while also reading his conversations with girls who responded to his \"man seeking woman\" craigslist ads. We turned on his google web history and watched him look up linux command line basics, golfing tutorials, and terrible youtube music videos. We also abused his google voice account, making sure Fred's friends and family knew how hard he was owned. Possibly the most interesting content in his emails are the IACIS.com internal email list archives (2005-2011) which detail the methods and tactics cybercrime units use to gather electronic evidence, conduct investigations and make arrests. The information in these emails will prove essential to those who want to protect themselves from the techniques and procedures cyber crime investigators use to build cases. If you have ever been busted for computer crimes, you should check to see if your case is being discussed here. There are discussions about using EnCase forensic software, attempts to crack TrueCrypt encrypted drives, sniffing wireless traffic in mobile surveillance vehicles, how to best prepare search warrants and subpoenas, and a whole lot of clueless people asking questions on how to use basic software like FTP. In the end, we rickrolled the entire IACIS list, causing the administrators to panic and shut their list and websites down. These cybercrime investigators are supposed to be the cream of the crop, but we reveal the totality of their ignorance of all matters related to computer security. For months, we have owned several dozen white hat and law enforcement targets-- getting in and out of whichever high profile government and corporate system we please and despite all the active FBI investigations and several billion dollars of funding, they have not been able to stop us or get anywhere near us. Even worse, they bust a few dozen people who are allegedly part of an \"anonymous computer hacking conspiracy\" but who have only used kindergarten-level DDOS tools-- this isn't even hacking, but a form of electronic civil disobedience. We often hear these \"professionals\" preach about \"full-disclosure,\" but we are sure these people are angrily sending out DMCA takedown notices and serving subpoenas as we speak. They call us criminals, script kiddies, and terrorists, but their entire livelihood depends on us, trying desperately to study our techniques and failing miserably at preventing future attacks. See we're cut from an entirely different kind of cloth. Corporate security professionals like Thomas Ryan and Aaron Barr think they're doing something noble by \"leaking\" the public email discussion lists of Occupy Wall Street and profiling the \"leaders\" of Anonymous. Wannabe player haters drop shitty dox and leak partial chat logs about other hackers, doing free work for law enforcement. Then you got people like Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko who back in the day used to be old school l0pht/cDc only now to sell out to DARPA going around to hacker conventions encouraging others to work for the feds. Let this be a warning to aspiring white hat \"hacker\" sellouts and police collaborators: stay out the game or get owned and exposed. You want to keep mass arresting and brutalizing the 99%? We'll have to keep owning your boxes and torrenting your mail spools, plastering your personal information all over teh internets. Hackers, join us and rise up against our common oppressors - the white hats, the 1%'s 'private' police, the corrupt banks and corporations and make 2011 the year of leaks and revolutions! We are Anti-Security, We are the 99% We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect Us!"},

{"text": "The set of laws that has allowed federal prosecutors to bring down traditional organized crime gangs should be applied to international cyber crime rings, a top Department of Justice official told a congressional committee on Nov. 15. The recommendation was one of several DoJ Deputy Section Chief Richard Downing recommended be made to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) during a House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security hearing on cyber security\u2019s new frontiers. The committee is considering updating the law. Downing said the CFAA should be modified to allow offenses to be subject to Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statutes. RICO extends penalties for crimes performed by organizations and allows the leaders of organized crime groups to be tried for the crimes they order subordinates to do. The move, said Downing, is needed because advancing computer technology has become a substantial tool for organized crime. Downing said \u201ccriminal organizations are operating today around the \u00a0world to: hack into public and private computer systems, including systems key to national security and defense; hijack computers for the purpose of stealing identity and financial information; extort lawful businesses with threats to disrupt computers; and commit a range of other cyber crimes.\u201d The organizations, he added, are closely tied to traditional Asian and Eastern European crime organizations. Downing said RICO has been used successfully over the years to bring down \u201cmob bosses to Hells Angels to insider traders\u201d and would be effective in the fight against organized cyber criminals. Downing also recommended the CFAA\u2019s complex sentencing provisions be streamlined and simplified and some maximum sentences be increased to reflect the severity of some cyber crimes. Prosecutors should also be given more latitude in pursuing the theft of passwords, user names and login credentials. Downing proposed that CFAA not only cover password theft, but other authentication methods, including those that confirm a user\u2019s identity, using biometric data, single-use passcodes or smart cards.\u00a0\u00a0 It should also cover login credentials used to access to any \u201cprotected\u201d computer (defined in the statute quite broadly), not just government systems or computers at financial institutions, he said."},

{"text": "OSLO \u2014 The biggest wave of hacking and espionage attacks in Norway's history has hit key defence and energy companies, the National Security Agency (NSM) said Friday. At least 10 companies have over the past year fallen victim to hackers in a string of attacks believed to be the work of one group, the NSM said in a statement. \"We have to suppose that the actual number (of victims) is much higher, but that many (companies) have not been in contact\" with authorities, the agency said. The security agency said it was difficult to track down the perpetrators, who used servers based abroad for their attacks, refusing to point fingers at any suspects. \"This is the first time that a hacking campaign of this magnitude has been detected in Norway,\" NSM spokesman Kjetil Berg Veire told AFP. The hackers in each case tried to gain access to the corporate network by sending seemingly legitimate emails to specific people, along with a well-concealed virus handing them remote access to the computer in question, according to the agency. But each attack was \"tailored\" for the specific company, making it possible to escape detection by anti-virus programmes, it said. The main targets of the attacks were companies in the oil, gas and overall energy sector, as well as in defence. The names of the targeted companies were not divulged. \"The attacks have on several occasions come when the companies have been involved in large-scale contract negotiations,\" NSM said. The attacks had allowed the hackers to gain access to documents, industrial charts, usernames and passwords. According to Berg Veire, however, it is impossible to quantify the possible losses, as an overview of what had been taken was lacking. A US intelligence report released earlier this month branded the Chinese the world's \"most active and persistent perpetrators\" of economic espionage. \"US private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China, but the (US intelligence community) cannot confirm who was responsible,\" said the intelligence report."},

Army officials said Manning is to appear at an \"Article 32 hearing,\" the first step in a court martial that could end up in a life sentence. \"The primary purpose of the Article 32 hearing is to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of the government's case as well as to provide the defense with an opportunity to obtain pretrial discovery,\" a Pentagon statement said.

He is charged with \"aiding the enemy,\" a crime which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Manning is the only suspect facing trial in the United States for the document dump -- a massive intelligence breach which led to an embarrassing daily drip of diplomatic revelations and military secrets in newspapers and websites around the world.

The details were exposed in a search page used by Telstra customer service agents that was left unprotected and openly accessible on the web.

Media reports suggested credit check details were also accessible but that was not confirmed by Telstra. Alarmingly, Telstra said it was unsure how many customers' details were potentially breached. \"(It's) unsure at this stage, it appears to be limited to bundled customers but we don't know how many,\" a Telstra spokeswoman said. In its 2011 annual report Telstra reported that it sold 659,000 new product bundles in the year to June 30, 2011. The privacy commissioner had been made aware of the breach and a full investigation and report into the lapse would be prepared as soon as possible.

In a statement release by Jumpers accountant Carolyn\u00a0Miller\u00a0she has stated the following'\u00a0\"As I understand, most people would be angry if their credit cards were compromised.

{"text": "man-less\u00a0spy plane, otherwise known as a \"drone\" \u00a0was landed and now in the control of Iran. We did a report on this and at the time there was a video that was released showing the drone. Well now a few on and its clear that this did really happen despite what the world thinks, these drones are indeed hackable, in-fact pretty much anything in the world is hackable. The Obama administration said Monday it has delivered a formal request to Iran for the return of a U.S. surveillance drone captured by Iranian armed forces, but is not hopeful that Iran will comply. President Barack Obama said that the U.S. wants the top-secret aircraft back. \"We have asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,\" Obama said during a White House news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki on Monday. Now its funny\u00a0because\u00a0of what the Iran Government has stated,,,, In an interview broadcast live Monday night on Venezuelan state television, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said nothing to suggest his country would grant the U.S. request. \"The Americans have perhaps decided to give us this spy plane,\" Ahmadinejad said. \"We now have control of this plane.\" Speaking through an interpreter, Ahmadinejad said: \"There are people here who have been able to control this spy plane, who can surely analyze this plane's system also. ... In any case, now we have this spy plane.\" So what will Iran do, what will they learn from this system? Is it going to finally help the world see what the American government can see with its spy planes and the type of surveillance they do with it? most of the world can probably already guess these answers and be right the 1st time but this will show evidence and proof. The real chances of Iran giving this back is fairly slim so what other options does that leave for America? will this mean Cyber war is real and we can expect more? or will it be another reason to send troops to another country and waste a whole lot of money. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Panetta said they're not optimistic about getting the drone back because of recent Iranian behavior that Clinton said indicated \"that the path that Iran seems to be going down is a dangerous one for themselves and the region.\" \"We submitted a formal request for the return of our lost equipment as we would in any situation to any government around the world,\" Clinton told reporters at a State Department news conference with British Foreign Secretary William Hague. \"Given Iran's behavior to date we do not expect them to comply but we are dealing with all of these provocations and concerning actions taken by Iran in close concert with our closest allies and partners,\" she said. Panetta said the request to return the drone was appropriate. \"I don't expect that that will happen,\" he said. \"But I think it's important to make that request.\" Now the above statement to me sounds like American definitely\u00a0has a backup plan that they expect to have to use....lets just wait and see what it will be."},

The RSA FraudAction service shut down its 500,000th online attack on behalf of its global customers and, to date, has helped them prevent an estimated US$7.5 billion** in potential fraud losses. The RSA FraudAction service is a proven and proactive managed service that is engineered to help protect customers, primarily in the banking and online retail industries, against phishing, pharming and Trojan attacks. The service is designed to provide 24x7x365 monitoring and fraud detection, real-time alerts and reporting, forensics and countermeasures, and attack site blocking and shutdown. Today, hundreds of global organizations rely on the RSA FraudAction service to help protect their customers against the latest online threats such as"},

{"text": ", the number of worldwide phishing attacks in the first half of 2011 (115,472) is up more than double over the same period last year (48,244) and nearly matches the full-year phishing attack totals for 2010. Despite this, the median phishing site uptime for attacks has decreased by more than 22% year-over-year (from 13 hours, 42 minutes, to 10 hours, 44 minutes). \"This milestone translates into significant cost savings for our clients and helps to establish the trusted environment their customers depend upon,\" said RSA President Tom Heiser. \"In the first half 2011 alone, the RSA FraudAction service saved our customers an estimated $520 million that might otherwise be lost to online attacks such as phishing and pharming. Not only does this enable customers to operate more profitably, RSA believes its work helps to raise the cost of fraud, making these kinds of attacks economically unattractive to cyber criminals.\" At the core of the RSA FraudAction service is RSA's exclusive Anti-Fraud Command Center (AFCC), an experienced team of more than 130 fraud analysts who work 24x7x365 to shut down fraudulent web sites, deploy countermeasures, and conduct extensive forensic work to help stop online criminals and prevent future attacks. The AFCC has established a network of dozens of ISPs and more than 13,000 hosting entities around the world and provides multi-lingual translation support in nearly 200 languages to further enhance its ability to detect, block and shut down sites on a global scale. \"Every hour a phishing attack remains active can be costly for the targeted organization such as a bank or online retailer,\" said Avivah Litan, Vice President and Distinguished Analyst at Gartner. \"Web fraud detection and takedown services have proven to significantly help reduce the lifespan of these attacks which helps minimize the potential of financial loss for targeted organizations and to reduce the distribution and potency of the malware that is typically used in these attacks to infect end users and harvest information such as log-in credentials and other sensitive data.\" The"},

We believe the AFCC is among the world's best at this, evidenced by how quickly we have been able to identify and disable attacks before they can cause widespread damage.\" The RSA FraudAction service is the recipient of numerous awards and"},

Now it mite be fairly harmless it stil shows that us, humans need to play our part in security properly or it will fail regardless of all the other stuff."},

{"text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (Dec. 23, 2011) - Go Daddy is no longer supporting SOPA, the \"Stop Online Piracy Act\" currently working its way through U.S. Congress. \"Fighting online piracy is of the utmost importance, which is why Go Daddy has been working to help craft revisions to this legislation - but we can clearly do better,\" Warren Adelman, Go Daddy's newly appointed CEO, said. \"It's very important that all Internet stakeholders work together on this. Getting it right is worth the wait. Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it.\" Go Daddy and its General Counsel, Christine Jones, have worked with federal lawmakers for months to help craft revisions to legislation first introduced some three years ago. Jones has fought to express the concerns of the entire Internet community and to improve the bill by proposing changes to key defined terms, limitations on DNS filtering to ensure the integrity of the Internet, more significant consequences for frivolous claims, and specific provisions to protect free speech. \"As a company that is all about innovation, with our own technology and in support of our customers, Go Daddy is rooted in the idea of First Amendment Rights and believes 100 percent that the Internet is a key engine for our new economy,\" said Adelman. In changing its position, Go Daddy remains steadfast in its promise to support security and stability of the Internet. In an effort to eliminate any confusion about its reversal on SOPA though, Jones has removed blog postings that had outlined areas of the bill Go Daddy did support. \"Go Daddy has always fought to preserve the intellectual property rights of third parties, and will continue to do so in the future,\" Jones said."},

A computer expert who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said the measure would have only limited impact. \"It can't be a very effective measure since the sites can be hacked from any corner of the world. However, it can restrict physical accessibility to the computers that store the data.\" Iran's Bushehr nuclear reactor was hit by \"cyber-weapon\" Stuxnet in what Tehran said was an attack by Israel and the United States. Western leaders suspect Iran's nuclear program is a disguised effort to develop nuclear bombs, while Tehran maintains it is designed to produce electricity. The existence of Stuxnet became public knowledge around the time that Iran began loading fuel into Bushehr, its first nuclear reactor, last August. Iran downplayed the impact of the virus and said in September that staff computers at Bushehr had been hit but that the plant itself was unharmed. Bushehr have missed several start-up deadlines. This has prompted speculation that Stuxnet damaged the plant, something Iran denies. Iranian officials have said the virus could have posed a major risk had it not been discovered and dealt with before any major damage was done."},

So it's disturbing that less than half of the agencies surveyed said they are ready to deliver the measurements required for the 2012 FISMA deadline.\" Other key findings of the survey: - The majority of the agencies represented, at 55 percent, stated they do not currently have the tools necessary to meet the OMB directive or are unaware if they do."},

Examples and descriptions of the kinds of crimes that the unit will prosecute are: - Identity theft - The Internet provides new ways for criminals to steal personal information and identities whether through email phishing scams or trolling the Internet for personal information about others. - Fraud committed using the Internet - This includes scams perpetrated via email and on Internet auction websites. - Theft of computer components or services - Burglary and robbery of computers or other electronic devices by highly-organized gangs at manufacturing sites, storage facilities and retail stores. - Intellectual property crimes, such as counterfeiting or piracy - Large numbers of websites and online networks exist solely for the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, such as movies, music and software. - Child exploitation - Disrupting online child pornography networks and those who commit sex crimes against children using the Internet or social media."},

The Victoria Police e-crimes squad searched reporters' desks and spoke with editor Paul Ramadge and a number of senior journalists and lawyers, according to the paper's owners, Fairfax Media. \"This morning a team of six Victorian police arrived at The Age at Media House in Melbourne,\" said Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood. \"The police have served search warrants and are presently conducting searches of electronic and hard copy files in relation to The Age's reporting of information on an ALP database prior to last year's Victorian election.\" The database, held by the ruling Labor party, contained secret files on tens of thousands of people, which included sensitive health and financial information that was being accessed by campaign workers. The Age described how the database could be used to search voters by name, address or stance on particular political issues, and contacted a number of people reportedly listed about the information it contained about them. Victoria Police told AFP their investigation related to \"the allegation personal details of Victorians were electronically accessed by a media outlet via a confidential political party database without authorisation\". But Ramadge said his reporters were approached by a whistleblower with \"legitimate concerns\" about the content of the database. \"That source provided authorised access to the database,\" he said after the raid. \"This was a story with significant public interest -- a powerful, highly influential organisation collecting private information on voters without their knowledge and giving campaign workers, including, it seems, volunteers, access to it.\" Though the paper was cooperating fully with police, Ramadge said they had \"grave concerns\" that their source may be identified, something he said would be a breach of media ethics and professional trust. \"If the sources for this report are identified through the police searches, even inadvertently, it will be a dark day for journalism,\" he said. Hywood said Fairfax \"absolutely\" stood behind its journalists on the story. \"I am completely confident that they investigated and reported this story in an entirely proper way,\" he said. \"It would be extremely disappointing if quality journalism, the public interest in the story and the integrity of what we stand for including protecting our sources at all costs suffers because powerful individuals didn't like what we revealed.\" The raid comes in the wake of the phone hacking scandal in Britain that led to Rupert Murdoch's News of the World being shut down and prompted a review of Australia's print media."},

The company was alerted to\u00a0the hack\u00a0on\u00a0Nov\u00a09th but failed to notify its clients of the hack until 25th of\u00a0Nov? why is this that it takes them 16days to get this done? The main problem we have in this situation is that in the world of money it cost the company less to keep it\u00a0secret\u00a0for as long as possible therefor they can still have the income making money and still possibly not loose as much in the end. If they was to notify customers as soon as they found out without confirming anything then they would loose a lot of money if they had made the wrong choice or a mistake. Now the above sounds bad, but in a business world it is just how they roll. Governments of the world could change this but then would this mean we are back to having to trust our governments to \"fix\" everything or be\u00a0in control\u00a0of every aspect of our\u00a0life's\u00a0and what we do. The one good thing about this problem is that\u00a0Restaurant Depot, in its letter to customers, said it would reimburse them for any costs they reasonably incurred as a result of the breach. For example, if customers are required to pay any fraudulent charges on their credit or debit cards, or if a bank charges a fee for replacing the compromised cards, the wholesaler will cover the cost. the letter can be found"},

Fear is the way how the globalist's want to control us, controlling our laws and establishing a police state which is what we are fighting against. We want our god given rights on privacy and being able to use our founding laws to control the government, not the government controlling us. We don't want the government to be groping us in airports, we don't want the government to enforce statutes to support the bankers but not support the citizens, we want a free government who listens to the citizens of the situating country and not listen to the globalist's. This is why humans have revolutions for example: Libya. The Libya citizens fought up against the regime because they thought they were being suppressed and cruelly controlled.

We use technology\u00a0 for everything these days and\u00a0its seriously\u00a0only very few left in the entire world who refuse to have anything to do with it. technology\u00a0 save's live's, makes processing data easier, brings down waiting times for transport or waiting in long tedious lines. Even though alot of us say we don't we depend on it in modern day living, the simple fact is it is\u00a0necessary\u00a0to have technology in modern day. These Cyber Warfare attacks can have serious effect on the way we work, act or even think. with recent groups like Anonymous who are non government related and fight governments, what do our governments do in\u00a0response? For years now there has been talk of a super army of hackers from china, but any smart person knows that\u00a0lot\u00a0of proxies end up back in china. Our Governments are just as much as risk as the every day user, sad\u00a0isn't\u00a0it? we pay all these high tax's for them to have\u00a0unsecured\u00a0networks of personal information exposed to the world. We have seen recent actions from the news of the world\u00a0incident\u00a0to operation\u00a0Orlando, where both have had a physical effect on humans from a direct result of some sort of cyber attack. Its time we, the citizens of the world take action and make sure the technology services and other services we use that store our personal information or have a effect on life, understand the need for higher security regardless of level of data. Can we do that? can we demand that our services are Proven to be secure? the way we see it is yes, as a human you have the right to personal security, that personal security being you're personal information that you have\u00a0trusted\u00a0a\u00a0third\u00a0party company/body/person to keep secure. These attacks mostly have an effect mentally, they change\u00a0routines\u00a0which makes humans forget simple stuff they do every other day, this mental stress of not being secure sadly a very common feeling, with almost all Internet users not feeling secure about the services they use. I personally know plenty of people who will not use internet banking, facebook, twitter, myspace for the reason they do not trust online security, they do not feel the \"security\" features websites have in place are effective. So in saying all this where are we going? Is it going to get to a point where we/us as a person can take personal legal action towards any company/government that allows information to be leaked/accessed via insecure systems? ill leave you with that thought."},

However, you obviously failed at one thing: Covering up your tracks. See, while you may now feel like a super hero (We wouldn't deny you that sense of being), you need to grow up. The world is becoming a dangerous place. We wouldn't want you to get hurt. But you know what? Hackers like you and I are targets. People love to see us get shot down. They think that our \"attacks\" upon them make us criminals... anarchists... traitors... and most of all, overall evil people. I want you to know where we are coming from. This isn't an attack on you as much as it is a simple embarrassment. You let your guard down. Think. If we have your emails, passwords, and IP addresses, we have your balls in our hands. Now, unlike LulzSec, we do not aim to profit from others' misfortune. This is not a stick-up. This is just a taste of our future. If we continue to do this on this same scale, people will come after us for the sole reason that we are in the news. I'm not sure how long our generation will last. One day we will have to report back to society and forget about all of this. But until then, I will assume that we will continue on with our current modus operandi. I look back on some things that have taken place recently and I wonder if they did the world any good at all. Then, I remember that the world is already lost; there is no point in trying to bring it out of this nearly 3,000 year-old hole. While Society lives, it resides physically on every plane of existence. Society lives. Eventually it will die. Now look at us. We do not exist. We are simply ideas; and if you know anything about ideas, you will know that they will never die. V0id, together in anonymity, we will live forever. We do not exist. We do not live. We will never die. For this reason alone, I want you be careful. We could have chosen to do far more damage. I mean, a Pastebin hack is hardly an example of the extremes some have fallen victim to online. I wish you the best of luck. We do not planning on hijacking any of your emails. However, if I was able to get them, someone else may have already done so as well. Please change your passwords and stay alert. With love, PiraX..."},

{"text": "Just to show I do have some rudimentary ability to find and check some facts should I choose to, this piece may actually have some credibility to it. I will point out sources, name them, and give them a shot at refuting my assumptions, and if there are any I will append them to the bottom of the post. Recently a fist full of individuals (th3j35t3r, gr4ssh0pp3r, Miss Mary, Web Ninjas, and Indiana Jones) claim to have finally outed Sabu. I have some fundamental issues with this information. And even j35t3r notes in his blog that it is entirely possible that its not really him. From Jesters Blog So only 2 scenarios exist: 1). Either @anonymouSabu is Hugo Carvalho and is desperately trying to mis-direct and deny. 2). @anonymouSabu used Hugo Carvalho\u2019s ID as another scapegoat hoping he would get doxed to hell and back. I personally subscribe to theory #2 and I will tell you why. Hacker and SE 101: These individuals generate burner id\u2019s, adversaries, and alters, track who is who, and go to extreme lengths to populate these generated id\u2019s with other twitters, facebooks, paypals, and domain holders. This is all an orchestrated campaign of misinformation and propoganda meant to lead people down the rabbit hole. It has recently been suggested that @anonymouSabu actually created @TeaMp0isoN_ as an adversary and played both sides of the fence, made some huge claims to be super 1337 and proceeded to wage war with @Lulzsec, Anonymous, and @anonymouSabu specifically. Now. Either this was all a sad little attempt at attention seeking by the pastebin poster (found here), A garden variety pastebin fraud, or a brilliant propoganda move on the part of @Lulz and co to misdirect, deflect, and promote their cause. The Response: Now, there are three basic rules of thought on how to respond to d0x1ng as well. The first and most popular is simply Deny Deny Deny broadcast to the world what a skid this person is and lots of rofling. The second is to acknowledge the false d0x1ng, and let the trolls exclaim from the mountain tops that they have achieved the unpossible thus diverting all attention away from yourself and to whomever this poor bastard is. Thirdly, and by far the most brazen, is to drop your own dox and challenge the world to \u2018come at me /b/ro\u2019 The Proof Now\u2026lets assume for a moment that Sabu is a mouth breathing window licker and he actually HAS all of his personal information out there someplace. Its possible. Question is, how much and where. Since this latest d0xing, I have followed links to a hi5 account, domain registrar information, a litany of registrar name changes after supposed d0x1ng attempts, a myspace account (my personal favorite), a facebook and a LinkedIn account naming himself as a CEO of HostSquadron. I would like to believe that these people don\u2019t go through as much trouble as possible to stay off the radar and then have everything but their dna profile laid out there on every social media site known to man. th3j35t3r has also quoted one of Sabu\u2019s tweets stating: @anonymousabu: If its not already obvious already: my!=hector/xavier/rafael lima/monsegur/de leon/kaotico/negron.Disinfos my game \u2013 enjoy the ridemates.\u201d Turns out all of these monikers are actually real people. And all appear to be registrants at one time or another on a domain that is believed to belong to Sabu. What exactly does this prove? Your assuming that the original purchase/transfer was done in the name given to him/her at birth. Just because you found the first person after the initial transfer still doesn\u2019t prove that the person listed is the actual person. That person could in all likelihood, be the end result of a carefully orchestrated dead end. Supposition Next, lets look at his actual responses. First of all, he ack\u2019d WAY too fast ! I scoured his responses and all I could manage to find that was on point were: @DustLavaRockSan @deadmanflying @KungFuCage OK You found me. I am Hugo. I am in Portugal. Next question is: Can you stop me? ;) @RichRoma I am honest. No need to hide who I am. Now come and get me. I have more surprises up my sleeve, putahna;) Now there could have been others that have been deleted, but even the clown doesn\u2019t show anything. Being that Sabu is a self admitted practitioner of the disinfo\u2019 can anything be taken at face value? The CNET reporter claims in her recent post to have gotten a response from an email sent to the only known email associated with the HostSquadron site that follows: \u201cI\u2019m Hugo Carvalho, and the story behind me and this nick guy Sabu is a complete lie. Someone stole my photo from one of my Web sites and started to spread the rumor that I was affiliated with this hacking group,\u201d \u201cFeel free to post this e-mail in your Web site and state that there is no relation between me and anyone related to that hacking stuff.\u201d Couple things strike me as a little odd here: 1. He allegedly states \u201cthis nick guy Sabu\u201d I don\u2019t know what information was given to this individual, but there was never a mention of previous name of Nick used. Another insertion of a name, OR, a confused individual. 2. A CEO of a hosting site really use terms like \u201chacking stuff\u201d Conclusion: As much as that whole time line plays out nicely, is possible, and appears on its face to be an exhaustive bio of one of the most talked about people these days. It is also just as credible to suggest that jester, teampoison, lulzsec, topiary, and the rest of the cast are all conjured alts of Sabu created for the sole purpose of misinformation, confusion, and entertainment. I think what we have here ladies and gentlemen, is a supreme psychological mindfuck and trollfest unlike any I have seen before. But hey, I tend to be that grassy knoll kinda guy.

War against the monetary system to get rid of money and monetary problems on earth, give the power back to the people.

So we decided to leak everything they got since they were established as a full scale cyber taskforce named CNAIPIC. This corrupted organization gathered all the evidence from the seized property of suspected computer professional entertainers and utilized it over many years to conduct illegal operations with foreign intelligence agencies and oligarchy to facilitate their lust for power and money, they never used obtained evidence to really support ongoing investigations. Today we reveal a whole Load of stuff (estimated leak would be over 8Gb) from such owned institutions, just to make it clear all of this stuff was stored on CNAIPIC evidence servers for years while people are doing time in jail waiting for the trial while CNAIPIC used the evidence in the global spy game galore: Egypt: Ministry of Transport and Communication Australia: Ministry of Defence Russia: Atomstroyexport, Diaskan, Sibneft, Gazprom etc. Ukraine: several embassies and consulates on it\u2019s territory Nepal: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Belarus: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Belneftehim, Belspetzexport Gibraltar, Cyprus, Cayman Islands etc: Tecno Develp, Line Holdings, Dugsberry Inc, Alpha Prime, Alpha Minerals etc. Vietnam: PetroVietnam (PTSC), Ministry of Natural Resources (MONRE) USA: EXXON MOBIL, US Department of agriculture and hundreds of attorneys and DOJ accounts including: McCallion & Associates LLP, Goodkind, Labaton, Rudoff & Sucharow, LLP, and hundreds of bullshit agencies we don\u2019t even know why we pay taxes to support all of them.

Looking at it from the IRC aspect as well, what legal rights does FBI have to use chat logs without Server owner consent? does this mean every other IRC server in the world ,which i must note is hundreds of thousands, are they at risk of being raided or arrested? Im probably pushing it a bit far in saying that but it really does seem the FBI is raiding anyone that even comes within contact with other anons. There has also been a very interesting story from the Parent of one of the kids who was targeted, This is on Reddit and states that the FBI came in with no search\u00a0warrant\u00a0at hand, took them 30minutes to produce one and they had there guns drawn and there was young teenage\u00a0children\u00a0in the house. all computer gear has been taken by the FBI, how ever the parent went out and brought a new one."},

The reason behind this is purely clear,\u00a0Recently it has been more so in the media that News International and a lot of its editors have been busted in a phone hacking scandal. Murdoch and news international editors get away with\u00a0a lot, they have hacked and breached the privacy of people, and this has been proven, people have been convicted and only made to pay compensation. If this was a normal every day hacker, that hacked phones they would for surely see the inside of a cell for a few months or at very least have some community service or house arrest conditions.

{"text": "The statements made by deputy assistant FBI director Steve Chabinsky in this article clearly seem to be directed at Anonymous and Lulz Security, and we are happy to provide you with a response. You state: \"We want to send a message that chaos on the Internet is unacceptable, [even if] hackers can be believed to have social causes, it's entirely unacceptable to break into websites and commit unlawful acts.\" Now let us be clear here, Mr. Chabinsky, while we understand that you and your colleagues may find breaking into websites unacceptable, let us tell you what WE find unacceptable: * Governments lying to their citizens and inducing fear and terror to keep them in control by dismantling their freedom piece by piece. * Corporations aiding and conspiring with said governments while taking advantage at the same time by collecting billions of funds for federal contracts we all know they can't fulfil. * Lobby conglomerates who only follow their agenda to push the profits higher, while at the same time being deeply involved in governments around the world with the only goal to infiltrate and corrupt them enough so the status quo will never change. These governments and corporations are our enemy. And we will continue to fight them, with all methods we have at our disposal, and that certainly includes breaking into their websites and exposing their lies. We are not scared any more. Your threats to arrest us are meaningless to us as you cannot arrest an idea. Any attempt to do so will make your citizens more angry until they will roar in one gigantic choir. It is our mission to help these people and there is nothing - absolutely nothing - you can possibly to do make us stop. \"The Internet has become so important to so many people that we have to ensure that the World Wide Web does not become the Wild Wild West.\" Let me ask you, good sir, when was the Internet not the Wild Wild West? Do you really believe you were in control of it at any point? You were not. That does not mean that everyone behaves like an outlaw. You see, most people do not behave like bandits if they have no reason to. We become bandits on the Internet because you have forced our hand. The Anonymous bitchslap rings through your ears like hacktivism movements of the 90s. We're back - and we're not going anywhere. Expect us."},

While inside the server @Abhaxas had access to everything, 20+ sites of data. Taking what he wanted and wiping the rest whilst lulz @ Joe the whole time. There has been another twist in this funny story as well with Joe's main twitter account posting tweets pretending to be @Abhaxas. To Put things correct and this is 100% confirmed @Abhaxas has NOT been on\u00a0@JosephKBlack\u00a0Twitter account posting tweets all morning, this is clearly Joe himself attempting to cover up all the stupid crap he has been doing. @Abhaxas confirms access but has NOT and WILL NOT use it, giving Joe a chance to come back and look like a idiot, which is much more fun. The tweets that are coming from his \"hacked\" account are very dam funny i must say, Stuff like content/images/gallery/teampoison/abhaxas-josephkblack-on-twitter.png So this is a excellent lesson to Joe, Learn to not go personal and even more stop trolling. IMO Joe deserves this, if i myself was to go on twitter and act the way he has been i would certainly expect to be hacked sooner or later. Information from Joes server."},

{"text": "I would like to start with saying Although this article may mention Anonymous and or LulzSec it is not directed directly at them, This is a statement about all hackers and the overall cyber war, this is our view on the inner cyber war the normal media\u00a0doesn't\u00a0report on. Recently we have seen the damage done by Anonymous and LulzSec and a bunch of other hackers. Generally when it comes to hackers, they work along, its a every man for its self type of game. In saying this there has been a lot more public dox'in, owning, and hacking between hackers. As many think this is not just white hats vs black hats, its white hats vs black hats, black hats vs black hats, and probably in extreme case's white hats vs whitehats so its all over the place. If you want to play in a hacking game i guess it is expected to be hacked, exposed or played with at least once in you're\u00a0hacking spree's. Now i will get this cleared up before i go any further, This hackers aren't just kids as most people assume, They are every day normal citizens, they are computer engineers, they are army officers ( off duty of coarse ), they come from a wide range of backgrounds, And I'm not only talking about Anonymous hackers, I'm talking about all hackers, They can be anyone from anywhere... One of the most common claims to the hacker rival world is to dox some one, leaking personal information in hope that it will make the target go into hiding or to feel shamed or in extreme case's get arrested. Another common move is to expose server information or DDoS the server offline. All this and much more can start from pretty much nothing, from a misleading or badly written tweet to claims of others using pre made tools like havij to do hacking to claims of being fake. You see a lot of this over twitter and on hacking forums where it normally picks up from one person releasing something another hacker doesn't agree with, so the other hacker takes action and it starts a doxing war between hackers/groups. Now this isn't anywhere near a new trend, its just that we now see more hackers coming out from the Worlds of private IRC channels to mingle with others on social networks, Networks like twitter play a vital role in today's communication and its no surprise that hackers are taking advantage of this free market to get their word/name out there. So does it really help win the fight releasing documents on other hackers? or attacking other hackers? are they even in it for a win? its hard to say. From my perspective, and by no means do not take this serious, i think its part of the game, its part of a hackers daily life, penetrating and leaking information, defacing websites and doxing other hackers. Now with Anonymous and very much more so LulzSec u get a lot of haters coming out, that disagree with what they do or say, now this would be expected, you must remember that when a whitehat says they are a whitehat, they most likely pose high skills and use them for good, good being within the law. Now u see bigger groups and more well known groups like the anons and lulzsec do not really fight back, they may release docs every so often, but it would seem they do not use any other means besides words."},

In the release statement on Team Poisons website, is a few interesting pointers. > Now we know of some of the things she was capable of but the next question we must ask ourselves is why would USA stop her from expanding her ideas and studies? her ideas would clearly make the world a better place right? 1. Why would the US Government not want a AIDS vaccine? Because the US Government created AIDS, its all over the internet, google it. 2. Why would the US Government not want peace with the Taliban? The US Government created Taliban, they funded them with money and weapons and trained them them to fight the Soviet Union. 2. Why would Zionist Jews of Israel want to get rid of African Americans and Hispanics living in the US? Israel is the puppeteer and the US is the puppet, Israel uses USA for security & money, deep down Israel hates everyone and anyone who is not apart of their state, but why would they target African Americans and Hispanics living in america? prisons in America are private businesses, The US Government gets paid 50,000 per year for every inmate in prison, now who are the stereotypical races that represent American prisons?

So hopefully one of the bigger media outlets pick this up, read the documents and figure out this\u00a0is\u00a0actually something that really does matter, unlike cadel being in the lead to win\u00a0Tour de France."},

Pool Table, Olhausen 9 foot Light to Medium in Color \u2013 $1500 (50th Izard, Dundee): For Sale in omaha $1500 very little wiggle room, however I will lower the price because of the cost a bit because of the disassembly/reassembly. It is in wonderful condition, so come over and have look, we can play a few games, and you can decide whether you\u2019d like to take her home with you. I bought it 5 years ago and played on it for 2 years. I am selling it because I just graduated from college and I don\u2019t want to find a job right away. Go figure.

{"text": "@ForFreed0m has released a press release and dump of info from the\u00a0Green Party in name of #antisec. PR: To every man, woman & child... We want an end to the glamorization of negativity in the media. We want an end to status symbols dictating our worth as individuals. We want a meaningful and free universal education system. We want substance in the place of popularity. We will not compromise who we are to be accepted by the crowd. We want the invisible walls that separate by wealth, race & class to be torn down. We want to think our own thoughts. We will be responsible for our environment. Dear internetz, today we bring you our release from \"Freedom Fighters\". I laugh at the New World Order trying to enslave us via the media and politicians lying, we want an end to the biased press whom want to destroy our freedoms via fear. Fear is the way how the globalist's want to control us, controlling our laws and establishing a police state which is what we are fighting against. We want our god given rights on privacy and being able to use our founding laws to control the government, not the government controlling us. We don't want the government to be groping us in airports, we don't want the government to enforce statutes to support the bankers but not support the citizens, we want a free government who listens to the citizens of the situating country and not listen to the globalist's. This is why humans have revolutions for example: Libya. The Libya citizens fought up against the regime because they thought they were being suppressed and cruelly controlled. That is because we are humans and not robots, good day to you.

Over the past we have seen government agency's attending defcon and its no different this year, with Anonymous and lulzsec out in force there is sure to be a keen eye from authorities watching over more often then other years. Over the past the the various agency's that scoop out the hackers look to hire them, this year the DHS has joined in the hunting game looking for hackers 4 hire, and infact iin 2009 Jess Moss was sworn in the the department of homeland security,\u00a0Homeland Security Advisory Council\u00a0as part of Obamas cyber Security team. This shows a change in times, in the 50's say they would be out hunting down rocket scientist or alike, now this days its cyber hackers, which proves they have an effect on the world regardless if we see it or not. so this year will they be looking for Anonymous hacktivist? imo its going to be impossible to find as there will be thousands of people that go through the doors, its cash only so there is no traces you was there.

Ryan for one was just a web host, and Jake Davis is said to be Topiary, the well known spokesman for Anonymous and more recently LulzSec. Now there is a lot of rumor going around that Jake Davis is\u00a0in fact\u00a0not Topiary, but the police are certain it is. Some of these rumors are backed by the\u00a0apparent\u00a0lack of good Internet connection in the location where Davis was arrested, that the police have been tricked into getting a different person then the real Topiary and in fact borrowed that alias name \u00a0\"Topiary\" \u00a0of another Internet user some time in 2010. As far as anyone from anonymous or lulzsec announcing or confirming his arrest, its been really quiet. with not much talk over the chats and a lot of speculation over the social media and main stream media. On @AnonymousIRC twitter account was a call for the law to free all arrested/charged anons. > FREE TOPIARY, FREE TRIVETTE, FREE OWEN, FREE TFLOW, FREE NO, FREE TRIVETTE, FREE ANTHTOPHOBIC, FREE ANANON, FREE ALL OF THEM!"},

So as the weeks go on I'm sure we will see more and more of Mr Davis life being brought to light, sit back and watch the on going show of Anonymous vs the law. Keep watching :)"},

So the question remains, WHAT THE HELL ARE BART THINKING, armed police officers in the subway system? come on its 2011, not the 90's we do not need guns everywhere on every law enforcement officer, for them to get happy and shoot at will and kill innocent people.

BART has proved multiple times that they have no problem exploiting and abusing the people. First they displayed this by the two recent killings by BART police. Under no circumstance, unless police are shot at, make police killings acceptable. Non-lethal weapons were available to use during both incidents, providing even that was necessary, but instead they shot to kill. Next they violated the people's right to assembly and prevented other bystanders from using emergency services by blocking cell phone signals in order to stop a protest against the BART police murders. Lastly, they set up this website called mybart.gov and they stored their members information with virtually no security. The data was stored and easily obtainable via basic sqli. Any 8 year old with a internet connection could have done what we did to find it. On top of that none of the info, including the passwords, was encrypted. It is obvious BART does no give a fuck about its customers, funders and tax payers,THE PEOPLE. The governments and government agencies of the world are becoming tyrannical and oppressive, and the people are responding and will not take your shit for much longer. The people will fight this oppression with protests, demonstrations, riots, hacking, ddos, online attacks and by any other means. We will not allow ourselves to be killed, exploited, or get shitted on. From the streets of Chile, England, Portland, San Francisco, Oakland, the people are rising up and we will support each other and stand in solidarity against any injustice. Worldwide resistance is happening, we will participate in solidarity against oppression. SOLIDARITY IS OUR WEAPON. Thus below we are releasing the User Info Database of MyBart.gov, to show that BART doesn't give a shit about it's customers and riders and to show that the people will not allow you to kill us and censor us. This is but the one of many actions to come. We apologize to any citizen that has his information published, but you should go to BART and ask them why your information wasn't secure with them. Also do not worry, probably the only information that will be abused from this database is that of BART employees. Greetz to TeaMp0ison, lulzsec, anti-sec, anarchists, anon, bay of rage, No Justice, No BART, UA in the bay, your anon news, anonymous irc.

For those of your politicians who boast of Kashmir being an integral part of India read your own law books: \" Indian Penal Code(Act No. 45 of 1860) CHAPTER-II SEC 18: \u201cIndia\u201d.- \u201cIndia\u201d means the territory of India excluding the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\" The 15th of August is special for you because you got freedom on this day yet you should think that do you really deserve to celebrate this freedom if you do not stop the wrong doings in Kashmir. Everyday people are not only being humiliated but killed as well. Fake encounters and rape is the order of the day in Kashmir. Kashmiris have protested time and again against Indian occupation and many people were killed mostly teenagers. When media tried to show it they were banned ( eg PRESS TV ), people were arrested for even protesting on Facebook and still India claims to be the largest democracy in the world. We ZHC will reveal what Your Govt try to conceal, if you really want to be proud of your nation rise for what is right. Support Kashmiris in their dream to achieve Freedom which is everyone's basic human right. We are ZHC - UNITED WE STAND DIVIDED WE FALL ..."},

We have learned that there have been more than 590 arrests with many more injured. We are Anonymous. You have gotten our attention. We will not ignore the cries of the children and students of Chile. And we will not forgive you for stifling the freespeech of your citizens. Public Assembly is a manifest right\u00a0granted by democracy. You, the Chilean Government, have attempted\u00a0to crush\u00a0this right.

A Extensive study has setup and follow this for a while and confirmed 9 ISP that take part in this scam. The actually scam, is when u have your browser u have the URL bar, normally when u type in there and hit search it will take you to your default search engine, \u00a0 yahoo, bing or google.

This service and these ISP's do no such thing. In the research documents released, they talk of over 4000 different IP's that are possible rouge servers intercepting data. So this really leads me to ask, what else does our ISP sell? How can this be classed legal in any way possible, If a hacker is found guilty of playing with a network, then why isn't an ISP or a company like Paxfire found guilty of data interception.

{"text": ":: 0x01 - Preface :: You may have read the about the various attention-whoring skid injections of LulzSec in the news lately, who hasn't? Apparently, anyone can pick up Havij, LFImap, or LOIC and make media headlines today. It seems they have succeeded in defacing the name of the anti-sec movement, turning it into a faux-revolutionary battle cry in the form of #antisec. However, anti-sec is not what it is being portrayed as. In actuality, anti-sec is the practice of keeping one's exploits and hacks to oneself for the good of everyone else (or personal profit, depending on who you ask). LulzSec, I would throw in a note here, but it seems I'm too late, most of you are already raided. To the rest, make your time. Not on the front page of the latest hacking busts and takedowns, the more skilled among us know not to broadcast our various 0wnages. We silently slip in and sift through large networks. Releases are private. Obviously, when you have a group that comes along such as Lulzsec, the question is not what they will get into, but how long they will last. More importantly, I would like to establish that the former Scene has very nearly disappeared since the rise of groups like Lulzsec. Blindly exploiting and staging large scale unjustified attacks against arbitrary organizations is not the mentality of hacking. Hacking is about curiousity. Hacking is about information. Attacking government entities so you can give the media your devoid justice statement is not hacking. It's called bullshit. I've seen enough garbage from Lulzsec releases. Today, we would like to provide the community with a special release, exclusively for all of the skidiots on Mibbit fueling Lulzsec/#antisec efforts. Enjoy. - HTP"},

Until recently Sean has been well known to be trolling the facebook fan pages and other accounts, defacing pictures of victims and harassing family members. Well his trolling run has come to a end and he is facing 18weeks in jail and banned from using social networks such as\u00a0Facebook, twitter,\u00a0Myspace\u00a0and others for 5 years and must report to the police any\u00a0equipment\u00a0that he buys that can access the Internet. Now this would seem to be extreme buy some and not enough by others but either way it shows the growing threat of jail time for using a computer and making stupid choice's in what you do online. The People who have been trolled range from a 14year girl who died after a epilepsy attack in her home to 16yo girl who died in a car crash. Sean defaced pictures and wrote nasty comments on the walls of the victims and there families. Its not the first time Sean duffy has been in the eye of the law for doing this either, in 2009\u00a0Duffy had been cautioned for a similar offence in 2009 and His Lawyer;\u00a0Whiteford said he lived an isolated life and had himself been bullied at school and work. The court heard that Duffy has Asperger's syndrome and lived a \"miserable existence\" drinking booze, So he is just another one claiming mental illness to cover up the crimes that he knew he was doing? is this going to be a new trend for criminal case's surrounding the Computer scene. Heart goes out to all the victims\u00a0families\u00a0and friends, we are sorry that you have had to deal with such a scum of life and that he went to the lowest possible levels to get himself some lulz. Now it probably seems like we are trolling him right now, but yeah he deserves it, \u00a0if you troll expect to be trolled. Original Article by"},

{"text": "note: my view :) Over the past few years we have seen a huge increase in the attacks on governments from other governments, hacktivist and every day pc users. From this the American government and many others are becoming scared of what could happen and are wasting stupid amounts of time, fundings and resources on monitoring this current situation. We recently came across an article about the Naval academy plans to expend to cyber security, the huge question here is why? why do the boats that float around need cyber experts? can we have pen pushers sitting on officers doing this? isn't that what the Internet is about, a big network that we can use to communicate? It would seem that they are scared to place a central command somewhere and would rather spread this all over the world and waste huge amounts of time, fundings and most importantly tax payers money. Now I'm not American, so this isn't coming from that aspect its coming from an outside view of what they are doing to themselves and how the world is looking at it. Even most of the citizens are wondering what the hell is going on with all this mis-funding and time wasting. Read the plans for the naval academy."},

{"text": "In a recent press release on the defense.gov website has stated that leaders and ministers from Australia are heading towards america to talk about the growing security problem we are witnessing daily in the cyber world, often referred to cyber warfare. Mainly they are joining forces to fight other rouge governments such as china in the constant flow of attacks to American computer systems. The obama administration has been pushing the fight for strong cyber security and also for more harsh jail terms for the hackers. This announcement comes from Leon E. Panetta and\u00a0Panetta will join Clinton, Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd and Defense Minister Stephen Smith for an official dinner tonight. Tomorrow, the leaders will hold consultations at the Presidio, where the ANZUS treaty was signed 60 years ago this month Now surprisingly enough Mr Kevin Rudd is Australia's Ex prime minster and he was one of the 1st followers of CyberWarNews on twitter, We find it very interesting that and also good that he is involved with this, Kevin is a very down to earth type of\u00a0politician\u00a0who does stuff in the best interest of the people, listens to the people and thinks like the people. CyberWarNews is Australian based and we also find this very strange that America wants to spreads its cyber bases here, as in theory cyber world can be accessed from anywhere at any time so why would there need to be a base outside of America for cyber security\u00a0monitoring\u00a0or problems? this raises huge questions in my eyes and there will need to be further investigation as to weather this is\u00a0true or not and if so why its to be so. So we can expect to see a fight by the governments, maybe not as much as some of us may want and maybe more then some of may want but either way its about time they got off there arses and did something about this now."},

{"text": "Over the past few months we have seen close to 100 different raids for cyber crimes, with a lot of these being related to hacktivist, hacking teams like Anonymous and LulzSec there has been a lot of other cases a long the way as well. Last wednesday the Obama administration has announced that it is pushing for tougher penalties for people who carry out \"cyber crime\" activities.\u00a0Associate Deputy Attorney General James Baker and Secret Service Deputy Special Agent in Charge Pablo Martinez said the maximum sentences for cyber crimes have failed to keep pace with the severity of the threats. Recently we have seen anonymous in protest for a fellow hacker who is facing a long time behind bars under the current laws. So the question is to ask why would they want to make tougher laws rather then try and fix the problem by creating a law for people who administrate websites with personal or vital information to be held liable for any of the information that may be leaked. Now the government has gone and called these groups gangs, terrorist, thugs and many other names and accused them of theft. While in many people eyes data leaking may be seen as stealing data it actually isn't. As the data is more often then not left in its original condition and a copy of it is taken and a copy of that is dumped online leaving the original contents as it was, now in some cases the hackers may wipe files but if this happens i also find it is the administrations fault for not having proper security or failing to do a back up if they\u00a0haven't. The Obama administration has also announced it has no plans to force company's to secure the information they hold, how stupid is this? its like having a working speeding camera at a race track. its a pure setup for people to be arrested and fined and possible jail time all at the expense of your tax moneys."},
{"text": "99.9% of hacks, defacing or data leaks are due to insecure websites, stupid administration, and poorly developed websites with lack of security or\u00a0sanitizing\u00a0of any input data. If they government made laws for Registered web hosts to do security checks fo the clients websites then maybe we wouldn't have such a problem on our hands as we do. also if web developers just relaxed a bit and stopped charging so dam much for little jobs the people who own these websites would hire real developers and maybe the security features would be all in place."},
{"text": "Yeah\u00a0that's it, anyone who thinks this will be stopped some time soon and that the government can actually do any thing about this is living in a dream. As stated before it really comes down to the admins and developers to fix this growing problem. all year i have been seeing reports that 2011 is year of the hacker and hacktivist and that it will forever be remembered, Maybe so but we have seen all this problem since the start of networking. Humans will be humans and take advantage, explore and do stuff that others disagree with, Just live with it and move on."},

{"text": "for CyberCrimes i would now like to look at what the hell is really defined as a cyber crime. It would seem that a lot of people think that minor attacks of hacking nature are crime related therefor cyber crime, this is far from the truth and pretty much off in a world of its own like the governments of the world. A Lot of the hacking that has been public over the recent months has not at all been Cyber Crimes, Do they class a basic DDoS attack with a premed tool and a random ip some one else gave u a cyber crime? How can they lawfully class any type of computer intrusion as cyber crime when they themselves the government will not enforce any type of security laws for the websites owners? So how can the hackers be breaking a law if there is none there in the first place? this is just totally stupid in all ways possible, unless they are actually stealing money or products there is no crime being done. Of coarse there is cyber crimes where people loose thousands of dollars and get ripped off in schemes and scams and in all these people should be prosecuted for the crimes they do as they are robbing people. But when it comes to files on a computer, that's all they are files on a computer. If the files and data was so important in the first place i do not see why anyone would put it on a peice of technogly that can make duplicates and distrubute it all in one action. So when some one says that they are stealing information they are wrong, the administration should have backups of all data, just like we do and these back ups should be kept offline to prevent any damage to them in case of the main\u00a0copy's\u00a0being\u00a0destroyed, either way this is not a form of theft of stealing in any way. Now data leaks are a whole different subject, in all most data leaks are harmless and leak no more information then what the orginal hacker has already seen and obtained, But in few cases u get exact personal details of innocent people being leaked online, this does breach privacy laws and if these certain hackers are caught then they do deserve the punishment they get. So really until the governments of the world sort something out and force\u00a0web developers\u00a0and web administrations, website owners to follow stick guidelines for\u00a0security\u00a0of information and user data then they really have no right to legally jail or charge or even arrest some one for DDoS or basic computer intrusion attacks. And Also until we start seeing these enforcement laws for web developers and administrations we will\u00a0continue\u00a0to see data leaks and website hacks roll out every hour from every corner of the world from every government and every site is a possible target if its security is lame."},
