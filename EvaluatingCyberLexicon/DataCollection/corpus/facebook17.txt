..I've read more... Peter - I think you need to take a sick day today, find this Adebayor guy and secure exclusive rights for the production of the TV series right away! ...Especially since it may soon be that he won't be able to sign for his own affairs... I see distribution in UK and Europe and all of Africa. Maybe Asia, Central and South America, too. I'd say English and French versions should go in-the-can out of the gate... The question would be whether the Mandarin or Spanish version would be third. Maybe go to work tomorrow - but spend the day having a chat with the folks in BBC world distribution about whether they want a piece of this.
