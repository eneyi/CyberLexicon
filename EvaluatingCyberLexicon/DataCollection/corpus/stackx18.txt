Worldbuilding is a great way to help maintain consistency for settings-driven story telling. From an efficiency standpoint, I think it largely comes down to individual writing styles. For me, when I write a scene in a novel setting, I constantly find myself stopping to think about how things work in the setting. Thinking through all those details interrupts the flow of my writing, so I'd rather get as much out of the way through worldbuilding background notes. That way, if I decide my scene needs to be in a seedy futuristic dive bar, I already have a good idea what that looks like.
