s a thick layer of smog enveloped parts of North India, Agra-Noida Yamuna Expressway turned into an accident zone after atleast ten cars rammed into each other at relatively high-speed, resulting in injuries to many. In a shocking video released by the Uttar Pradesh police, cars crashed into each other due to low visibility even as people were screaming and requesting drivers to slow down. As the air quality in Delhi dropped to ‘severe’ category, the Delhi government has advised people to restrict their outdoor movement. Multiple flights and trains were delayed because of low-visibility in the region.
