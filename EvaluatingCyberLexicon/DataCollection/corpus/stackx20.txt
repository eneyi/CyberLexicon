It also depends on the type of story you're telling. Philip K. Dick, for example, sometimes appears to have put great effort into worldbuilding (The Man in the High Castle comes to mind) and other times just seems to throw in random world details that don't appear at all plausible or thought out but are instead symbolic or humorous.
