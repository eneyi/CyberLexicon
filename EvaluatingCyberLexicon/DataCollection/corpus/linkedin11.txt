Brilliant read and hope this post bring more awareness to more companies. Hacking is extremely real and can happen to any company if measures are not in place. I can't stress the importance of 1) educating employees about phishing. 2) Review your current systems and finding out if they are still fit for purpose as technology and hacking advance. 3) Good data and security prevention process. 4) Always back up and keep data that you only need.
