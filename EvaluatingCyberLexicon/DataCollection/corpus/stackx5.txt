So here is the issue: I have a 500 GB Hard Disk in my laptop, currently I have linux (Debian 9) installed on it. Now I wanted to dual boot my laptop with Windows 10/8.1/7 in one of my 60GB unallocated space, but I can't install windows 10/8.1 in that unallocated space even after formating it as NTFS in gparted.
