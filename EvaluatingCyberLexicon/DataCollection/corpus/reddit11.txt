I've had technical jobs all my life, about the last 20 years or so. They've all been hands-on jobs using electronics and electro-mechanical skills, and a couple years back, I decided to shift my career toward a computer-related career at the suggestion of my better half, who is a software engineer. I took the cautious route and got 60 hours at a community college, then transferred to UH, where I am majoring in CIS. I'm using the GI bill and due to the gating of the major-specific courses, I was looking for other options to maintain above 12 credit hours per semester while going through theses clases, when my advisor pointed out the accelerated BS/MS program leading to a Master's in Information Systems Security.
