Just so we are all clear... $50 OBO means that buyers are welcome to immediately buy the item for $50 or offer you less and hope you accept said offer. While you are under no obligation to accept any specific low-ball offers, you are under obligation to sell the item if they offer you full price. OBO does not imply bidding.
