I'm 100% new to cybersecurity. I was recently hired in marketing at a company that makes Threat Intelligence Gateways (TIGs). I took the role because I'm very interested in cybersecurity, despite my non-technical background, and the TIG space is fairly new & still considered "emerging" (which is fun!). I don't want to name the company because I don't want to be a shill or identified - there are multiple companies that make TIGs.
