Hello and Welcome Uertmon, while I can see this question isn't about an actual world you are building I hope it stays open because its about worldbuilding as a hobby. I personally do it as a hobby because I enjoy it. You don't need a reason to invest time in a hobby. But sometimes a hobby can be pretty consuming with no benefit. Its a matter of self control so you can keep world building and living the life you want. Is there any reason in particular you want to stop world building?
