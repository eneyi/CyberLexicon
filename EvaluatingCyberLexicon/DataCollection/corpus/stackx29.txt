He offered to sell the book for $50. The other person accepted the offer. Why is how much he might be willing to pay relevant? Sure, he may be willing to pay $60 for the book, but why should he when an offer was made to sell it to him for $50 and that offer was accepted? The other person is trying to hold the OP to the terms he offered, but willing to go up to $60 if the OP is not going to honor his original offer. You're suggesting the OP should fail to honor the original offer? Why?
