It's a good answer but it's missing Onofre's input. It's not just about realism but about consistency. Star Wars has sound in space everywhere, down to characters hearing a fighter behind them. This breaks realism but if kept consistent you can accept it. If they suddenly remarked there is no sound in space it breaks the consistency and becomes annoying. The consistency of "AI is out to kill you" (or a semi-insane support tool often found in Ancient Tech Is Always Better) is such a trope that people will readily accept it.
